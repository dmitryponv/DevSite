2. World Hate Center

Now do you feel respectable on the cross?
Hanging by the shred of life that we lost
Greet the pain, meet the nails
That we thrust into your chest
Now it's time for you to repay us

Never judge me
It fuels my hatred
Join the searching
And lead the bloodshed

We will track you down and nail you
Unto the cross with thorns
We will do this with precision
Make sure you'll regret you were born
Only when you ask forgiveness
We may pretend that we care
Yeah sure
You my friend represents the sickness
And we shall be the cure

We shall be the healers of our time
Strike back, twice as hard then proceed
Can you feel the hate that flows divine
And soon the world belongs to me

Never judge me
It fuels my hatred
Join the searching
And lead the bloodshed

Now you bow your head in shame
So where's your power, sinner
Your weakening becomes my gain
And this you shall repent
Alas the hourglass of life
Is destroyed beyond repair
Never ever speak my name
Or I'll cast you in despair

Beware
I'll cast you in despair

Save your soul
In a world hate center we reign
Save yourself
In a world hate center of pain
Save them all
In a world hate center we're torn

Now do you feel respectable on the cross?
This time the world belongs to us


3. 11 Dreams

Talk to me
Tell me your vision
The answer
Lies deep in you

Obey
These voices keeping you sane
Trust me, I promise
I won't lie again
Never ever again

No
We are you dreaming
No
The dreams you're feeling

So far away
We have to remember this day
It's there in your eyes
Like diamonds ablaze
Sleepless we walk
Through the valley of dreams
We live life long enough
Like lifeless machines

Listen

Now
We're learning children "be brave"
Their future may never be safe
You and me and I
Through this web of lies

No
We are you dreaming
No
The dreams you're feeling

So far away
We have to remember this day
It's there in your eyes
Like diamonds ablaze
Sleepless we walk
Through the valley of dreams
We live life long enough
Like silent machines

You and me and I
Through this paradise
You and me and I
Through this paradise

No
We are you dreaming
No
The dreams you're fearing
Sleepless and cold
The moonlight guides me
Shadows unfold
The path of arival

So far away
Remember September the day
With tears in your eyes
They will never be the same
A kingdom without a king
A prophecy of the free
Save us all from within
Start believing the dream

Sleepless I walk
The moonlight burns you
Voiceless I talk
The silence awakes you
Lifeless I stare
My eyes make you listen
Dreamless I dare
Make this your vision

So far away


4. Redestructdead

My imagination
Leaves a contradiction in my soul
Still the situation
Has left me searching high and low

Human touch
A machine that man created
ReDestructDead
That's why I hate

Everlasting rain
Upon my window
Whispering my name
Dreamer
To cast a silent shadow

Lightning strikes again
The sky is blood red
Thunder wind and reain
I'm reDestructDead

Now my aggravation
Turns on me like nightmare tales untold
Never my intension
The sunlight shining, I'm still cold

Turn your face
And walk the other way
Don't look back
Look back in sympathy
All these years
I've been living in solitude
No more tears
Whatsoever I still hate

Everlasting rain
Upon my deathbed
Whispering my name
Dreamer
I'm reDestructDead

Lightning strikes again
The sky is blood red
Thunder wind and reain
I'm reDestructDead

As the seasons change
And the moonlight's gone
I will try to

Burn the bridge
And make me confident
Tear at my skin
Behind this decadence
All this time
There's no one left for me
None divine
And forever I will hate

Everlasting rain
Upon my window
Whispering my name
Dreamer
To cast a silent shadow
I'm reDestructDead
Everlasting rain
Upon my deathbed
Whispering my name
I'm reDestructDead
Lightning strikes again
Lightning strikes again
The sky is blood red
Thunder wind and reain
I'm reDestructDead

Into the rain


5. Firesoul

Come closer
I dare you to fall asleep

Cross my heart and hope to die within my sleep
As I believe I'm being stalked inside a dream
I start to run, my legs are numb, I beg you please
My blood dries out, my body's cold, the rivers freeze
The rivers freeze

Helplessly I lie in wait for what may appear before me
And desperately I seek of thee; spare my soul, deceiver

Steal my heart
Then take the rest of me
Free my mind
Let me float away
On this feeling
Even though this insanity
Seems to me reality
Take my final thoughts away
Leave me be on my deathbed

Fade away
My dying day
The fever takes control
Deceiver takes my soul
Light the sky
This dying night
The flaming torch will burn
The path of no return

I seek revenge as I escape the maze within
I need the key to turn the lock that holds me back
Then I am free, fast asleep
I walk in dreams, firesoul hang on to me
I'll make you scream
I'll make you scream

Helplessly I lie in wait for what may appear before me
And desperately I seek of thee; spare my soul, deceiver

Falling into you
Dreaming
Trying to find you there but
Even though this sanity
Seems to me reality
Take my final thoughts away
Leave me be on my deathbed

Fade away
My dying day
The fever takes control
Deceiver takes my soul
Light the sky
This dying night
The flaming torch will burn
The path of no return

Firesoul

In my sleep I fall in deep
Into the sea of dark desire
Haunting me, stalking me
Helplessly, I'm still dreaming

In my sleep I fall in deeper down
Into the sea of dark desire
Haunting me, stalking me
I'm helpless
Watching me
In my sleep stilll dreaming

Cross my heart and hope to die within my sleep
As I believe I'm being stalked inside a dream
I start to run, my legs are numb, I beg you please
My blood dries out, my body's cold
The river's frozen

As I swim through you, my fire soul
Swims through me and
When you stole my heart you took control
Let me float away
On this bed I lie awaiting you
Take me with you now
Still asleep I wander in your dreams
I'm deceiving you
Take control as my blood dries out
On this dying night
On this dying night


6. Sharpen The Edges

At night the voices speak through me
To me
Sets my mind adrift, it floats away
Slowly
Dragging me down unconsious
Sleep tight my dear, I've come to kill
If I can't have you, then no one will
It gives me the thrill

Into the everlasting grace
In the mirror I'm the man without face
Only the name's been changed

Candlelight upon the blade
Whispering now it's time again
My knife bleeds with desire and anger
My hand shakes, can't hold on much longer
No, it's time for us to become

One, we are
One, we've become
One, we are
One, sharpen the edges once again
One, we are
One, we've become
One, we are
One, sharpen the edges once again
Prepare the pain

You look so peaceful
Now you're gone
So please forgive me
I've done wrong
And still the voices
Are calling me
Back in the shadows
I belong again

Into the overflow
In the mirror I'm the man, I don't know
Even though my name's the same

Candlelight upon the blade
Whispering now it's time again
My knife bleeds with desire and anger
My hand shakes, can't hold on much longer
No, it's time for us to become

One, we are
One, we've become
One, we are
One, sharpen the edges once again
One, we are
One, we've become
One, we are
One, sharpen the edges once again
Prepare the pain

Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges
Sharpen the edges


7. Supremacy v2.0

As I reflect upon the past
Seven years in hibernation
Breaking the silence at last
What's become of my creation?
Now I can see into the future
By the power of yesterday
Nine six six six
The year of supremacy

Supremacy

Let's die
Let's die

Questions regarding what we create
With the use of technology
Answers are when we start to simulate
The fall of humanity
Fall
Never rise

If you could see into the future
Interactive history
Simulating a new start
Random access memory

We're closer to the edge now
One push and we disappear
There's no need for you to blame me
I'm no longer the one you fear

Raise the flag for me
Raise it real high for humanity
Raise the flag for all to see
Light the sky with burning supremacy

Tear the flag down
Hold your head high

Be your rage
Don't be so hollow
Be your rage
Don't be so hollow

Cyber head put on your mask instead
And hide in three dimensions
Drown yourself inside the shade of red
Feed your inspiration

Inspire me

If you could see into the future
Interactive history
Simulating a new start
Random access memory

We're closer to the edge now
One push and we disappear
There's no need for you to blame me
I'm no longer the one you fear

Raise the flag for me
Raise it real high for humanity
Raise the flag for all to see
Light the sky with burning supremacy

Tear the flag down
Hold your head high

Be your rage
Don't be so hollow
Fly with me
Beyond tomorrow

Now I can see to the future
By the power of yesterday
Ask me anything
I'll tell you everything
All the details in my memory

We're closer to the edge now
One push and we disappear
I'm the old man warning you
I've been asleep for seven years
Cast aside
My dreams denied
Living each day hiding
Behind the mask, we never rise
Giving in, we're dying

Supremacy, supermacy
You are supreme to me
Supremacy, supermacy
Forever supreme to me


8. Music Non Stop

[Kent cover]

Everybody gets a second in the sun
I have a feeling mine has just begun
Music non stop when I close my eyes
Clarity born from such a compromise
And you're almost like me

So why don't you dance to the music
I hear inside my head
Why don't you dance to the music
It's the soundtrack for the end

I'm looking for a place to lie in wait
I quit my job to find a perfect fate
Music non stop when I close my eyes
I need some time alone and I found a carpark that is home
You're almost like me

So why don't you dance to the music
I hear inside my head
Why don't you dance to the music
It's the soundtrack for the end

Everybody gets a second in the sun
I have a feeling mine has just begun
Music non stop when I close my eyes
Clarity born from a compromise
And you are almost like me

So why don't you dance to the music
I hear inside my head
Why don't you dance to the music
It's the soundtrack for the end
Why don't you dance to the music
I hear inside my head
Why don't you dance to the music
It's the soundtrack for the end


9. Falling

Infiltrate them
Disintegrate them
Terminate my fire
Create your own desire

Don't let them drag you under
Towards their paradise
I am the fallen angel
The only one am I

Be my dream this night
Hide me from daylight
Shelter me all times
Hide me from the light

Help me free you
Save yourselves from their eyes
See what holds you
And controls you

Infiltrate them
Disintegrate them
Terminate my fire
Create your own desire

And now the stage is falling
Towards their own demise
Don't look to me for answers
To questions I despise

Be my dream this night
Hide me from daylight
Shelter me all times
Hide me from the lines

Falling down
Crawling down

Deeper into the surreal landscape
Interlocking this dream reality
Remind me to remember to forget
My vast collection of memories

But they will paralyze you
To hide the things they do
The scene is set for freedom
So slip away from me

Be my dream this night
Hide me from daylight
Shelter me all times
Hide me from the lines

Falling down
I'm crawling down
Falling down
I'm crawling down
Falling down
I'm crawling down


10. Times Without Changes

In times without changes
Changes in life
Life without reason
Wondering why

Why keep searching
Seeking someone
Someone to guide me
My guiding light
Guiding light

I know the answers
And you know who I am
Tell me your vision
And take your stand

Times I remember
All of my lies
One through eleven
My memory dies

Times without changes
Changes in life
Life without reason


11. Loneliness

The one that makes me stronger
Still pulls me under
Leaves me on my knees
The one
That makes my heart beat
Still makes my soul bleed
Bleeding piece by piece

You see
I am your destination
Where you always want to be
A heartfelt emotion
Cast aside and then I feel

Lonely
We are not alone
Only
Nothing to atone
Someday
I hope I hear you whisper
Always, always
I do, now we've come this far

Never make mistakes
As long as loneliness awakes

The one
Simply completes me
Still don't believe me
Even though I know
The one
Is still under my skin
Still makes my mind spin
And turns me upside down

And still our lives passes by
Day after day, we never speak
Sometimes we start to wonder why?
But then we're going back to sleep

And then we fall to pieces
We are lost in loneliness
Close your eyes, believe this
We are one, one

Lonely
We are alone
Only
Nothing to atrone
Someday
I hope I hear you whisper
Always, always
I do, now we've come this far

Never make mistakes
As long as loneliness awakes

Lonely
We are alone
Only
Nothing to atrone

The one that makes me stronger
Still pulls me under
Leaves me on my knees
The one
That makes my heart beat
Makes my soul bleed
Bleeding piece by piece

The never ending misery
Of living life in loneliness
Seal my eyes and leave me
I am one

Lonely
We are alone
Only
Nothing to atrone
Someday
I hope I hear you whisper
Always, always
I do, now we've come this far

Never make mistakes
In life we dedicate
Our souls to someone else
Laft dangling by ourselves

Only
Lonely
Only
Lonely
Only
Lonely
Only
Lonely
