Send my ashes to the stars

Darkness descends as she hunts among them
Call forth now her beauty of northern lore

Shines among the cliffs and moors
Kinship with sage and druids of elder shores
Illumination, lanterns for harboured keeps

Feeble light 

See through my eyes 
All the shame I have inside 
How sorry I am 
So much tears because of me 

My cold winter pain 
Has kept me away from your soul 
A sombre smile of innocence 
Is lost forever in the snow 
  
I was the one who tried to feel warmth again 
You were the one who made me believe again 
Remember the hours passed with passion 
You (only) remember your darkest sorrow 

Prey for life again 
Just a little sign of faith 
To believe the truth in me 

Give me a grip in life again 
Let me see the sun one last time 
Forget the past, it's only pale souvenirs   
Filled with tears and shameful darknessThe death is around me
God is far from me
I see the evil, in my heart
The death is all around me
Please rescue from this hell!
I feel the end in my soul

Rescue me!
From this hell or I die 
I serve the light, remember this! 

Death, I will be your death!
Where is your authority?

Jesus says:
Destroy the blasphemous gate of malediction
March on the ashes of the black empire
Destroy the infamous rites of desolation
March on the ashes of the black empire
This inner desperation is sort of malefic religious

No clammy hands can alter me
My God! 

Remove the tears from my eyes 
Take me in your hands
And never feel fear again

Wind be my lord
You are
Wind be my lord

You take me away
From this world before I dieAs some blades piercing my flesh
I tear myself to pieces
With the poisoned blade

Sometimes this gave me life
Or was it someone?

She disappeared long ago
In a flowing river of memories

Where I lie somewhere dear
The leaves fall in a tomb of mine
Where I lay to rest
For an eternity of lonelinessI am ballistic
A cannibal, making them suffer with my drill
Boiled flesh heads decapitated in my freezer
Putrefaction genitals jarred, my meal to be
Jeffrey Dahmer feeding of bodies, disposing of limbsBegotten in rape
Blood of the giants runs in his veins
Mother gave way to him on this world
The outset of new splendid legend

The fairest hair around his face
Beautiful, healthy, strong body
Surrounded with dwarves, brought up by the- dwarves
He had no equal to him

The seven summers passed fast
Child in Black Forest, alone
Fear, darkness, Nature and strength
Wolves and the forest demons around him
Slavic God of Fire protected him
Then fear he defeated,
His place in the house was restored
Yet that wasn't his own people
But Destiny came to him
Giantess of untold beauty
Became his lover and mother
She shaped and guided his fate

Yearning to act - this lethal sickness
Drove him to the adventure
The only cure for despair
Are the praiseworthy deeds

Is he a dwarf ? or is he a giant?
Your value is proven by you

The life-goal is to be in power
For power is sweeter than honey
More pleasant than her bosom
Shall you known its secrets
The power is by your sideFeast upon the living flesh, drink the blood of the nameless one, not caring for its cries or pleads for mercy, tonight it dies, so I may live. Ones demise shall give me life the fore, the essential fluid that emits life. I will take with no remorse tonight its end is nigh.

From blood drinker, I'll turn to ghoul. I'll consume both the blood and the flesh, tonight your bed is one of the earth and you'll sleep the sleep of death. As I feast on the sweet nectar of life. I'll oust secrets from the guts of this once breathing lice to obtain knowledge from the dead if I will it for necromancy is my greatest pleasure.
Tonight's first kill was easy prey preoccupied with the wench that he mounted. Grasping hold of its happy little head tearing from its trunk

From this one that I now devour, I find it has victims of its own only for sexual pleasures the lowest form of the human worm. Lacerating the cranium dislodged and ripped out of the brain, the juices of this organ I savor the most. When there is nothing more that I care to seek out in this one's hollow head. I'll drain him dry, leave his remains, food for the maggots. Then I see coming up from behind a challenge to be met, the knife he yields makes me want to laugh as I crush his bony little skull, down he goes with not even a whimper but, he to me is like the rest of the scum, substance for a vampire. But what of the wench thou ask, what hath become of her this night doubt thee, angel of demise.
Ripping through the flesh and drain thy blood from this wench who struggles for life. I shall leave her clutching her steaming guts decapitated and drain dry. My thirst for now has been fulfilled, the sun is on the rise, so for now I shall rest for the blood that I have consumed from these three.
And as I sleep, the blood will be adsorbed by the parasite within, that animates my once human form. For it is the reasoning of my undead existence, the justification for my blood lust and as nix comes to fall, I shall arise and set forth my nocturnal thirst for blood, for again this night I shall feed on thy blood of the insolent man. For these that I have slain, it shall not matter man is too ignorant of what lurks in the night another static to add to their list another piece of forgotten flesh.

From blood drinker, I'll turn to ghoul. I'll consume both the blood and the flesh, tonight your bed is one of the earth and you'll sleep the sleep of death.Ghastly souls
Spoke words untold
Brooding offermort
In chaos savage
Beside your instincts
On Malicious time
A mass illusion
Blind man

It's standing there
Behind the shadows
The moon is setting
Holds the only light
Watching with its dead eyes
Consume the absence
At eleventh hour
You don't have a chance

How the world
It's too old
Cold fingers wrap
By a black mass

In mystery of time
Heritage of tomorrow
Your last life drops
Falling into infinityA memory of a time
When we were proud to live our dreams
There'll be no compromise
Standing tall, we will be supreme

PRE-CHORUS:
No-one could crush our will to be
This time we're gonna make them see...

CHORUS:
The resurrection time is now
Forever we survive
Back from the grave to take control
Forever...
The resurrection time is now
Returning from the fire
We have the strength, we have the power
Forever we survive...

They tried to tear us down
Rape our hearts and steal our dreams
This time we won't hold back
Glory bound, we claim our victory...

the lingering pest
beneath him

ignoring the signs

I try to justify her truth
Hide emotions behind reason
Control seems closer to abuse
When tears no longer show her pain
I'll commit her to reveal my name

It does not hurt... it never did...
It does not hurt... I won't submit...

Kisses from a distant dream
Another mind has left, but she
Remembers only what she knew
Our world was just a piece of truth, for
Less was said than done, and thus
I close my eyes before this past
Not to build up constantly
A future we will never see

Es tut nicht weh... es geht vorbei...
Es tut nicht weh... verzeih... verzeih...

Different times and different reasons
But all I've ever known is you
Unable to erase my feelings
That caused the pain that I went through
No longer try to understand
I'll learn to trust, please take my hand(Instrumental)Faith Open my mind Blood Wash my hands
Death Give me power Goat Is the only master

Give me power to drink my enemies' blood
Give me power to crush and to grind

In the universe of pain
In the castle of my revenge
In the forest of darkness in cold winds
Goat raise my power

In the sea of black worms
In the abyss of deadly deamons
Under the sign of total genocide
I`m calling you

Goathorned Lord!Take my pale hand
And scream into the wind
I shall drown your face
In bottomless seas of grey

And carnage ensued
As manifolds of skin
Were torn apart in fury
By the claws of time


The merciless pace
Of space and time
Will force you unto your knees
With screams of agony

The end of the sky
Opens up before you
Wall of black never-ending
A most impressive sight


From gas we emerged
Hatred reveals its face
Full of sores and blisters
Only death can set you free

Cowards longing to die
Their bodies, so lifeless
Too weak to stand
Carressing the filth

Born with fatal illness
Known to most as 'life'
Tormented by the imminence
Of death at the end

Engulfed in poppy haze
A torrent of scorn
Loosed upon all life
You close your eyes and smile


The falseness of all life
Is the only thing
We will ever know for sure
Oh, what a relief


You lost yourself in grief
You left the world behind you
All light turned grey
As you approached the surface
Planes deprived of emotions
You wish to be an empty shell
Bathed in blood and dread
Detached from man and animal


Take my pale hand
And scream into the wind
I shall drown your face
In bottomless seas of grey

And carnage ensued
As manifolds of skin
Were torn apart in fury
By the claws of time


The merciless pace
Of space and time
Will force you unto your knees
With screams of agony

The end of the sky
Opens up before you
Wall of black never-ending
A most impressive sight


From gas we emerged
Hatred reveals its face
Full of sores and blisters
Only death can set you free

Cowards longing to die
Their bodies, so lifeless
Too weak to stand
Carressing the filth

Born with fatal illness
Known to most as 'life'
Tormented by the imminence
Of death at the end

Engulfed in poppy haze
A torrent of scorn
Loosed upon all life
You close your eyes and smile


Frost and fire collide
Joined in terrible distortions
The end of mortal coils
New beings emerge from the dark
Born out of destruction
They walk the void, indifferent
Without point of reference
Marching in the dark

Unaware of all surroundings
Beasts are raging in the dark
The earth shook and trembled
Under their mighty hooves
Rebellion against all values
War on the old world
Absorbing its misery
For souls do not exist

Betrayedwhy should I deny
that I will not resist
how could I decline
when I am still prone
welcome
to the weird travel through my wood
of uncertain emotions
the wedlock between laudable and barren dreams
welcome
to my world
a circus of nakedness
chase these thoughts away
take my lust away
welcome
to my inner side
enter the disaster
drill yourself into the fat
go inside
welcome
to the sexual and imperious art
chase these thoughts away
take my lust away
sell me a smile
and I will give you happiness

Shamyasa, Jomael, Aramos, Satarel
Rehumel, Asmodai, Azazael, Bachanael.You say a lot by looking right through me
You don't care that I want to be me?
Your influence has got me hypnotized
How come I never realized?

It's time for me to open the door
To step outside and look for more
To leave behind this life on my own
The real world now to me is shown

I possess the wisdom
You won't make it on your own
I'll let you go for now
But you will never be alone

I'll lose the shackles that still bind me to you
There was a time when I was blinded by you
Now you only stain my sight
A strong reminder of the fright

The anguish, the sorrow, frustration and more
Liberty waits, when I walk through the door
Walking free I try to find my way
Immersed in a light I see another day

Now I follow my inner drive
I finally feel alive
There is a decision
Your choices have been made
The Fatekeeper has spokenThe galloping of the horses sounds closer
Silently on the mountains edge
We watch our enemies
Soon the battle will begin
To slay the mortal souls

With heart as stone and spirits of fire
We unleash the beast within
And attack in full glory

With swords in hands
We conquer the lands with might
With fury in our eyes we trap the human race
Crushing their lives and laws
Till they exist nomore
Soon the earth belongs to us in all eternity

With heart as stone and spirits of fire
We unleash the beast within
Born to slap humanity we attack in full glory(Instrumental)To get rid of our last temple
Cold like a grave
Through the storm of the primal lies
Under the sun of the filthy lambs
Crushing avenger from the blazing sky
Above the lake of the fleshles wolves
Reasoned a monotonous chant so grand
Anthem to our fall in the great masquerade
The eternal rest will never be found
Aphorisms stabbed the mortal allegories
When the blood poured without reason
Wings of eternity so pure - so white
Breathed a strong wind of hopes
First showers of a new black era
Leathers stained by the crimson streams
Appearance of the older stigmas
Sneaky rapture betrayed by grins

Riding the elements
The flight of a messiah
The flame which warmed my heart -
You - the majestic one

Drinking our tears sad countless tears
Freezing of all the black sins 
Weakening the primitive whiff
Gleaming the best from our lugubrious glint

Riding the elements
The flight of a messiah
The flame which warmed my heart -
You - the majestic one

Adrift on the water
Behind the immense walls of fog
Alone - tired and ill 
Out of the wounds come the slugs
Struck by the plague
Wrapped in the dark
Tarnished as my heart
The dying swan

To get rid of our last temple
Cold like a grave
Through the storm of the primal lies
Under the sun of the filthy lambs
I cry for the avenger of my blazing sky
Roarings above plains
The embrace of the evil on your distraught wings
I play to forget that I have pain
Black thoughts rot my lugubrious fate(Instrumental)Putrify...Eviserate...Abomination...Mutilate
Crucify...Desecrate...Another dies...Asphyxiate

I'll fuck your Mother's still warm corpse...I'll Sodomise
While Father sees it all through now lifeless eyes
No tears shall fall the blood will rain, Death's glassy stare
Mutilation, Uncreation of those you hold dear

Scream, Cry no one will come...I'm cloaked in fear
Bleed and die maggot, writhe in pain, no one will hear...you

Disfigured...Brutalise...Atrocity...In your eyes
Stygian...I decimate...Mangled...I seal your fate
Your life...I despise...Immolation...Hear your cries
Jugulation...Pain and fear...Trucidation...Your end is here

Crushing your head under my boot, insecticide
Stillborn ripped from your mother's womb, Aborticide
My vengeance upon hated life shall never tire

Tell me. Do you feel like your brain still works?(Instrumental)Despondent in my way but what can I do?
A reason to be concerned when my rights are abused
Penchant for disorder, disorder for a cause
Helping hands make light work to smash down these walls,

To be taken advantage of
An opportunity for self gain
Fueled by selfish desire
To put right my ways
Pain fills my heart
Anger fuels my pain
A meaning for my reason
In a world that's so insane

Breathing down your neck time presses on
Can't change yesterday, It's already gone
I won't despair, I can't pretend
Take the bull by the horns and fight till the end

Enraged with good reason - is your cause for alarm
No subtlety in my reaction or my indignant charm
Fight for relief, choice of belief
What is to be taken away is the beginning of the end

To be taken advantage of

Fueled by selfish desire
To put right my ways
Pain fills my heart
Anger fuels my pain

No subtlety in my reaction or my indignant charm
Fight for relief, choice of belief
What is to be taken away is the beginning of the endThe ice starts to melt
Executing the ritual
The avalanches starts too
And your roars are the warning

Your fall is the sign of terror
That make everybody hide away
Except the thirteen warriors
Whose destiny was known... was known!

Dartherium, radioactive attack darther...

In the midnight sun your face was seen
Dartherium in glorious triumph
Tracing through tales, the silence of fear all feel

The celtic warriors are no cowards
Grasping ancient holy shields
And fighting against the death

Vitory was known
Dartherium speed along ice
Fed by the more brave blood
Came back vitorious to the shelter

With him, years of fight go out
With him, the hope goes out
And the glory of the celtic warriors, goes out!!!This city was built of glass
 No status of race, creed or class
 Follow the gold put your wealth at rest
 No possessions will make the tribute here
 Tongues forget how to pronounce time 
It's irrelevant to construction a missing blueprint
 Systematic pleasures an oasis to create
 So many kings in this place
 
Food upon the table clothes upon the back
 Fragrance applied generously thick
 With fists of gold clenched tight go blow for blow with the midas touch
 
The knights color outside the lines
 A mission of distribution
 The shade is hard to find
 
These hands will build it and they will take it away...
 
Deconstruct or construct it's all the same to the sculptor
 Manufactured life the product known well
 These gardens cover tracks 
The suspect disappears a magician of the build
 Power of powers who dare challenge magnificence?
 When it's at play there's so much to gain
 I will wear the blueprints upon my sleeve
 And the tools above the head
 
Standing high above mountains rejoice
 The flood never past our heads
 Always on the move the vessel stops for none
 Productivity on a rise answered by the one
 Throne made by lions so sit large!
 
Food upon the table clothes upon the back
 Fragrance applied generously thick
 With fists of gold clenched tight go blow for blow with the midas touch
 Has this path been laid for those that travel in servitude?
 Or can the giants lengthen their stride?
 
Raising the towers gluttonous expansion
 Honor of invisible worms
 To appease the birds eye!
 
These hands will build it and they will take it away!
 
Food upon the table clothes upon the back

 And the tools above the head
 Power of powers who dare challenge magnificence?
 When it's at play there's so much to gain
 
Standing high above mountains rejoice!I'm simply not here
Non-existing in sadness
Overwhelmed by fears
I hate myself
The more the pain itches
The more I feel alive
Blood is my counterweight
The wounds are healing
but I'm not healed

Mental monologues keep me frustrated
Out of balance on the thin line called life
Progressively I'm wandering toward the edge
When will I fall down?

Smiles pass before me
I can't help but feel so fucking scared
Slowly but steady I crawl within myself
Hiding away from you

My mind slips
I tremble
Cannot get up
Please just kill me
There's nothing to do anymore

I can't help but smile all the way to the grave
Pain is like a drug to me nowWell, you know that it must be right.
If you've got that certain feeling.
You know that it can't go wrong,
Let's work it out some way.
If you've got love and understanding,
We'll make it stay together.
Forgive me if I hold on,
Our love will last forever.

Will you give your love to me,
In the Fear Of The Night.
Will you give your love to me,
When the time is right.
In the Fear Of The Night.
In the Fear Of The Night.

Now you've left and it's all turned black,
And the darkness closes in.
There'll be light when you come back,
But when will that be.
Time has passed and things have changed,
Now the night has turned to day.
I have lost that certain feeling,
And your the one to blame.

When you left me all alone,
And the fear was closing in.
Did you know what I was going through,
I couldn't see what to do.
Maybe I should feel the night,
I couldn't see what had the night.
What is wrong? Who can tell
What is right? Could it be Hell

Will you give your love to me,
In the Fear Of The Night.
Will you give your love to me,
When the time is right.
In the Fear Of The Night.
In the Fear Of The Night.

When the time is right - In the Fear Of The Night.
Give your love to me - In the Fear Of The Night.

Our bonding, trust is at hand 
Go we must, to Satan's land 
Pray for death, and cry for life 
Reaper's breath will breathe new life 

Satan's child, he is born 
And to death he is sworn 
Days of hate, and days of pain 
Endless term of Satan's reign 

Endless dreams, in the night 
Eternal sleep, eternal fright 
Defiled crosses, oh black mass 
Satan's reigns, me at last

The beauty of your stinking world 
Will turn to morbid orgies 
The beauty of your stinkink world 
Will be spotted with his own blood(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Down the sour drains
Below the world you think you know
Where man does never tread
For no sun ever shined that deep down low

Down the rotten dark
From the filth of mankind it is born
Breathing the stench of rancid sewage
Growing as a freak in the decayed brewage

From life it sets all free
Indulged in its killing spree
Disguised as the one to be
Draped in disease

Medication set aside
No cure here to confide
In your veins it then shall hide
Draped in disease

Subterranean growth maligned
Abomination the kind
Balterium lord of twisted mass
Eyeless but not blind

Feasting the excrements
Of a thousand infections severe
Crawling as a snake
In the spreading epidemic lair

Down the fluid hell
Stained are the walls with its poisoned breath
Roots of pestilent plague
The rates abide its ways as a tail of death

Down the hive of chills
From the filth of mankind it now feedsMy anger must be supressed
As I wake in a fit of rage
For that I take it out on a child
No more than seven years of age
Her flesh so pale
Her virginity so pure
She could never imagine
The pain she will endure
Fucking her repeatedly
She's become my little whore
Though God even knows
I'm in search of more

I've sighted an elderly man
Lying crippled in his chair
What will become of him
He is so unaware

So very old
With no sense at all
A mere obstacle
He too will fall

Grabbing a sledge
I cave in his head
As his lungs collapse
He gasps his last breath
Ripping flesh till all but bones are gone
My work here is finished
I now will move on

I come upon another victim
An expecting mother
I put my arms around her neck
We struggle with each other

Though she soon
Will come to learn some
Respect, as I pull her head back
I slice her fucking neck

Leaving her to die
Send her to her tomb
Now I may rip
Her unborn child from her womb
Taking it as my own
I no longer have resistance
As I brutally beat and sodomize the bloody infant
Holding it up in recognition
In that I've already won
Though sometimes I find myself wondering
What have I become?Crusting the gate of power desire
You wanna heist you was so blind
What prepared me in stood sow avouches
More are feed close your eyes

Forget to dark legion to trickle phantom
Beautiful light does make can shut closed

Now are push come to grow swim to moonlight
Trap here alone trying this shoved when awake
Down in forth come to Hell trait to moonlight
Down in beauty and make of the day out of time
To dark pleasure lout in mate beautiful north
To the gates we fore up to see we could fade away
Dream be freedom fulfilled, freedom forever laud in mach
Torn the pleasure move in dead to see what ever clout

Its great descend veil dark it trough
Torn for flesh we return here::."ATTA-ATTA"

Standing out and make be out it shut down
Its time to look the fate I am afeed you in black
Spay to motion in chaos finally screw would this stopped that laugh
Make ache of serpent's heart letting to scream splash down in fly ends
To fight to left and right land are winches this captured defeat

all the scum, and cut their pieces!
wait until they're awake
and make their tears my laugh
i want to cry...
cry out my rage
watching them die
from famine, murders and pain
oh... the whispers..
how sweet they are
when begging my cruelty
to let them live... live?
so let's keep them live
to kill them every new day
lets practice a new murder...
believes, creeds and deeds
then they are meaningless
and now i notice...
they always were
so i get up... and kill them againWhen fear is flowin' through your veins in the night
death 'round the corner with its unforgiving bite
then maniacs are ready for a fight!
White collar pencil-necks, you know there's no escape
they'll sew their emblem on your mortuary drape
burn your houses and your women they'll rape

(chorus:)
Animalistic rage - heretic rites now take the stage
Ritualistic view - now there's nothing stoppin' you, Mad Thrasher!
Mad Thrasher! Mad Thrasher - of Satan's Metal!

Like some ghost of a repressed and horrid fear
lurking inside you, stroking hard on with a sneer
your lips tremble when Mad Thrasher draws near!
Unwilling concubine just let me have my way
I've killed your minister and now I wanna play
Perverted pleasures are your gospel for the day!

(repeat chorus)

We're heavy metal maniacs!  If you're enslaved...
you'd better watch your back (the lash!)
You're damned to be a schizophreniac (don't look back!)
livin' in fear of the mad thrash attack!
We'll play shark with your soul, and jinx every roll
of the black eyed dice, and it's your call
When you're ridin' with the hounds, or the pigs run you down
you're the venom of the maniacs' spite!
You've a barbarous itch, to bring down the brazen bitch
Your blood roars for a fix
We've summoned the dire, cast morals to the pyre
the boundaries of Hell are rent tonight!

(repeat chorus)Dark Blasphemic Vision
Noktocolus, 2001

The final day passes by, the sun dies, darkness arrives.
Pure demonic summoning up on the hills.
Dead trees, frozen oceans, ravaged earth.
Angels decay, 12 disciples crucified, the holy ghost extinguished.
The holy whore, bawd at sodom. Her son nailed on the wall.
Grim storms, earthquakes, Genesis turns to nothing.
Total death, collapsing cities, mankind genocide.
Demons rising, legions marching, satans supreme victory.
The apocalypse, armageddon, heaven burns.
Gods throne crumbles to dust.
Ravens sing the eternal dirge as time hunts down to zero.Nights came tralling ghost concertos,
heartstrings a score of skeletal reaper bows.
Playing torture chamber music allegretto,
conducting over throes trashed to crescendo.

Skinless the dark shall scream,
hoarse her symphonies.

Deathmashed as the moon that had lifted her dreams,
And frowned on the winding steps down. 

To where the vulgar strayed,
taunting sick her tender prey, 
she glided in her bridal gown!

How sleep the pure,
desire in violent overture?

An emanation of phantom madness,
the Countess beheld in shroud.
By girls bereft of future vows,
soon to wed in white the frosted ground.

Burning like a brand on the countenance of God.
A yearning took her hand to his seraphim, bound.

Deep red hissed the cat whips,
on the whim of her ill-will.
Whilst she entranced, nonchalant, abliss.
Flayed further songs of overkill.

How weep the pure,
desire in violent overture?

In a crescent-whime cellar of crushed roses,
pooled blood and broken dolls.
A torchlit shadow theatre souled,
with the echoed cries of lives she stole.

Killing time, 
she struck the hours dead in her control.
Thus menopaused, 
her clock of hacked out cunts began to toll.

Thirteen chimes of ancient strain,
I conjure forth with dirge.
That fills the void with timbred pain,
to fulfil my sexual urge.

Frights came wailing from the darkside!
Haunting lipless mouths a fugue of arcane diatribes.
Velvet, their voices coffined her in slumber!
Bespattered and appeased, as pregnant skies outside bore thunder.

How sleep the pure,
desire in violent overture?

Desire in violent...

As when high winds attune whipped trees,
her savage nature pitched.
Would once again conduct the pleas,
of those she loved to agonies.

As if it were the first time every night,
that she carved her seal in the flesh of life.Now finally meting & without cause
Rotting in blasphemy. Running , caught & hung.
Mortal we remain, a nothing dread.

Appearing to us a blackened heart & soul.
The progress to shroud their light of gold.
A belief in nothingness can lead to truth & pain.
I travel back in time to persecute faith's liars.(Instrumental)"...When the Nebula descended upon the Earth
Came grace and enigmatic silence
...and Winter reigned it's throne
Forever..."

Thy marble glance of darkened eyes
Regained guilt of paradise
The fear and chaos, thorns with spikes
Were demonized, this is demise

Another sun, but the same light
Another day, but the same fight
Another god, but the same fear
A razor, veins, the end is near

The fall of angelic dominion
We celebrate where angels die
The fall of angelic dominion
They're paralyzed and fall like stars

Upon the shores of endless time
With pride we stand
We hold the power
As lucid sun is setting down
Thy lord has gone with tragic final

The bloody clouds and black horizon
Will turn the page and god has gone
And melancholic dark malice 
Embraced it's (sic) throne, satanic throne

I see what have never seen before
Is it a harmony or war?
Or kind of magic in my eyes
This is demise?

The fall of angelic dominion
We celebrate where angels die
The fall of angelic dominion
They're paralyzed and fall like stars

Awaking from eternal sleep
Forgot my name oh... who I am?
Or am I mask without a face?
Or am I him?Gaze at the evening star
I'll hand you into dark and cold
There's no way to follow, nowhere to go
Welcome to my land where time stands still
Ready for the storm
To avoid old sores bleeding
I can't do that you've done better

Unclear thoughts never say just a single word      
For my songs and verses
Dry my face to go

Tread into the ray of light
just walking forth
However I'm afraid to stand the gate
and knock on the door
Wait for someone hears my voice
and opens the door
To somewhere unknown now
I'm walking my eyes blinded

Unclear thoughts never say just a single word
For my songs and verses

*Life is goin' on and on
My spirit lets me rise again
Stand in the light and wind
So feel again, here I am
Life is goin' on and on
My wheel of fate spins forever
Don't need to cry for bygones
In your life

* repeat

Yin and yang and days and nights
Too many times it's turned and rolled
Stand in a shower and gale
So say again "I'm here to stay"
Find out something deep inside of myself
trying to prick my nerves
Don't need to cry for bygones

Life is goin' on and on....Glory to you, of Lucifer
The fair god, god of the light
Glory to hajah-ehejeh-jihejeh
Only you we praise, we pray
Love and invocate
The infamous Nazarene oppresses you
Temporarily for he can figth you
But he will never win you
Yes, oh god og light
To the persecuted one
We send our affection
We feel that the end is near
Protect your faithful under
Your beatuful black wings
For the wish to live in hell beside
You oh mighty Lucifer
Lead us into the delightful
Pleasures of the flame
Reanimated in the opprtune dew
Image messenger of welfare which
Await us
In your eternal Kingdom
Accept this song and take us away
Of the lier Christ take us away
From the soft god, god of business
Praised be Lucifer: the one and onlyIn the black night
An underground site...
We pledge our allegiance!
All in robes we have come in droves
To lend our energy

Satan's fire will illuminate
Black light will generate heat
The frost blanket that covers the ground
Will unveil a new world

As the voice of Satan fills the wind
Our ears are open to let him in
We've come for assistance once again
We will force upon them reckoning

We are Prophets of the Beast
Communication with the devil himself
We await your words, my friend
We will soon take action...

I have heard your request
The time is upon us
To abolish creation
We must destroy

The fallen isn't fallen at all
Choice freedom over tyranny
Now he's willing to assist in our fight
So that we may see the light of Liberty

I have escaped the wrath of slavery
I have no master
Man shall be free as well
In enlightenment
Through an alliance with satan

The fallen isn't fallen at all
Chose freedom over tyranny
Now he's willing to assist in our fight
So that we may see the light of Liberty

He left on his own accord
The bible has deceived us
The lesson he has taught us is to stand up for your freedom
Against all enemies

I have heard your request
The time is upon us
To abolish creation
We must form...

An alliance with satan
An alliance with satan
An alliance with satan
An alliance with satan

Satan's fire will illuminate
Black light will generate heat
The frost blanket will unveil a new world...(Instrumental)Impio cuerpo, despertando de la tumba
Con ojos sonrientes imagina de nuevo la luz del dia
Victima de una mutilacion - y destripamiento
Con la voluntad de vengarse, vuelve una vez mas a la vida

Cadaver Vindicativo 

Con recuerdos fragmentados del horror que vivio
Aun asi recuerda claramente la cara del perpetrador
El cuerpo escarba la tierra, hasta ver un rayo de luz
Se levanta de su tumba, emanando su asqueroso hedor

Cadaver Vindicativo

Busca un brazo, enterrado en otro agujero
Sus intestinos (colgando) de su barriga - lo hacen gritar de dolor.

Heridas abiertas que no volveran a cerrar lo torturan
En lo que queda de su mente, solo hay deseos de cobrar.

Sediento de sangre, bebe de sus propias heridas 
Para acechar a los vivos, la abominacion vuelve a la vida.Black Goat

Can you feel the power?
Can you feel the madness?
Moonlit forest brings me gladness
Can you feel the ecstacy?
Can you feel the rapture?
Can you know what it's like
To become more than human?

Do you feel the netherworld?
You thought it was just fantasy
I have tasted other worlds
In my frenzy of ecstacy
Can you feel the ecstacy?
Can you feel what it's like
To become more than human
We have assumed animal forms
In the astral we hunt
Lycanthropes
Power from The Black Lord
Atavistic ResurgenceTo the sea from the ice,
the sun coming down again
an elderly abyss seizes the light,
turning the day into night.

From the depths of life, to the shallows
follow in the footsteps, of the mighty ones
restoring order, pillaged way of life
obscured by night, feared upon at first sight.

We all rise, once again, in darkness we reign
we are the answer, we are your hope
shallows of the ancestors.

Rising through the abyss, as a pioneer of curiosity
an endless stream of shadows, night veiled existence.

The earthly journey, a symphony of lost men
as sand of time displaces slowly in the hourglass of infinity
sculptures of renaissance, as horizons decree
the end of a mighty empire, as far as the eye can see.Come Forth, Baal who strikes as Set 
Strike terror into the heart of my enemies 
I call upon the Sentinels of the Abyss 
To witness the demise of my foes 
May their days be filled with despair 
Their nights fraught with torture and pain 
I call upon sender of nightmares 
To terrorize their kaw 
They have denied the Gift 
The Dark Fire shines not with them 
They stand in the Hall of the Two Truths 
Their hearts are weighed alone 
Unbalanced with the Feather 
The scales reveal the truth they betrayed 
May their days be filled with despair 
Their nights fraught with torture and pain 
Their minds drip deceit 
Their thoughts are false hopes 
The dirge drowns their flame 

Feed their minds to Setnakt 
Send them to Osiris 
Their presence plagues us not 

May their days be filled with despair 
Their nights fraught with torture and pain 
May their days be filled with despair 
Their nights fraught with torture and pain 
May their days be filled with despair 
Their nights fraught with torture and painSo you came to me for answers Hateful to utter laughing aloud
Here it stands defiled and proud stained of shroud and disembowelled
Out of the shadows where hate dwells kneel
Present your throat Shadows behind us gather
You looked sad, rolled your eyes 
little girl Virus chewed host through passages hot burrows in furrows and sorrow 
Did I scare you? Didn't find a shroud that fits you? Love the sound...
...As earth covers you. With no way out what else are you here for?
Cast aside in the whirlwinds of war Fly in Darkness
Expiring Cries pour the venom from my eyes(Instrumental)(Instrumental)In the night I burn a big bonfire
And I hail to the dead... the ones I loved
I'm crying in a hailstorm and I curse the life
I can't help it, when the feeling comes...
In the night...

I have made my way through the storms...
I have used my strength to survive...
I have paid my respects to the gods of nature...
I have bled for you, but now you're gone,
No-one can hear my longing...
In the night...[December '95 / Music: Necromass / Lyrics: C. Blasphemy]

Looking all around, fire all around, collapsing, appalling,
crucified, into flames, walking... into the warmth
infernal breath... into the warmth
horizons are turning into: horizons
are burning
horizons morbid
horizons symbolic...

horizons burning, tremors perturbing: body, mind, soul (are:)

Crossing the plain of mind devastation
into the trip of mind laceration
across the fields of endless obsession
voyage through, personal disturbs...

across the time, across the pain
there's our sky unites earth
crucified... crucified

into the warmth of darkness, I see the past, I see horizons,
I see they're dead, looking back, looking back
unite black sun to planet earth.

Across the time, winds cut the mind,
there's the sky unites unites earths
crucified... crucified

into the warmth of darkness, I feel the past,
I see black planets are going to rest,
look at them, look at them...
delirant passages through death.

Body, mind, soul... are burning

Into the warmth of darkness, I see the death,
I see our planet is going to rest,
looking back, looking back: CRUCIFIED BASTARDS CALLED MEN

Horizons burning, tremors perturbing
Horizons burning, tremors perturbing
Horizons burning, tremors perturbing: BODY, MIND, SOUL

Walking the plain of mind devastation,
into the trip of mind laceration,
across the fields of endless obsession,
voyage through, personal disturbs.Horrid screams, all around,
Bodies piling on the ground.
Children cry for their parents,
Their spirits ascended to the heavens.
The wealthy go into the unknown
Poor people die in the black hole
Pestilence spreads throughout the land
This is not what we had planned




death will shroud land and sea...... to dust, gone with history...
mutations, abominations, deformations, destroyed  all nations
asphyxiations, desolation, Population...To Damnation.

All you see....its what life's become to be...This is not a dream...gruesome blasphemy!...


 "Earth, air, water...and despair!"

Mangled bodies, blackened and burned to dust!
Toxic waters, blood turns into rust
Chaos Growing, The civilization falls.
Torment and Torture, Death has called!

".... glance at the earth's destruction.. tear rippling down the eye.
...blossomed light has gone, ... wave goodbye...
Her suffering will soon begone....New beginning...Spawn...
The profanation left, made by us beings...without(Instrumental)Just when I thought it all was lost
I found it
And as I tried to count the cost
To count it

Drawn to the light, I can't be still
Nothing can stop me

(Chorus)
Bound for Glory
Don't try to stand in my way
The prize before me
You know I just can't stay

Keeping my head above the waves
Don't down me
All of the world will be my stage
All 'round me

This is my dream, I won't be denied
Nothing can stop me

All of the children growing older
All of the embers left to smoulder
All of the weight upon my shoulders
All of the seasons getting colder

(Chorus)
Bound for Glory
It's there's a will there's a way
The prize before me
Girl I've just got to play

All of the children growing older
All of the embers left to smoulder
All of the weight upon my shoulders
All of the seasons getting colder

All of my thoughts that I'm revealing
All of my life I've had this feeling
All of my secrets I'm concealing
All of my moments that I'm stealingSHOCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's a sign of good times, It's a pleasure you will be mine, We will go back to my place and drink some wine and into my arms baby tonight your mine
SHOCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm gonna rock ya
It's the three finger punch, One in your ass and two in your cunt, It's a sign of good times, It's a pleasure you will be mine, We will go back to my place and drink some wine and into my arms baby tonight your mine
SHOCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm gonna rock ya
It's the three finger punch, One in your ass and two in your cunt
YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(Instrumental)The wings of a black damnation
the blades impale the whore
this rightious infestation
breeding weakness in us all
their wrists are slashed to etch pentagrams
drawn within their flowing blood
I've inflicted myself with pain
to envoke his awful name
fermenting and rotting, the heavens are crying
their innards will dry for their flesh shell has died
from living to dead to the grave they'll succumb
conform unto death and dissolve into dust
cadaveric, now they lie, the earth their final home
as endo parasites oblige and set their course on which to grow
time will take its toll, and drip away their skin
rots beseiged its carrion feast and laviditys set in
chorus
misanthropic autopsy, angelic diagrams are drawn
charnell structures petrified, mausoleums for the lost
silenced in their death to serve a higher purposeUnion of the races
So far from each other
High above they came
With stolen gifts the outlaws descent

Falling as lightning from heaven

Bearing treasures of gold 
Riches with jealousy guarded
Carrying the precious chalice
Holding within liquid death

The murderer's daughters
Opened themselves up
With ecstatic delight
To the splendor of the winded serpents

So were the great men of gold beget
Those whose blood still flows
Yet slumbers
Waiting to be awoken again

Sip from the cup of the fallen
Poison it holds does now run through
Feverish trembling and gasping for air
As the chains are breaking(Instrumental)Can't see the consequence, the world turns into ice
No reason to pretend, its now, we die
So hard to comprehend, we're hanging by a thread
Humanity has failed, we're dead

Lost forever, here we are
It's sickening to see
Thought that never, it's go this far
So future here you go - here's your dying world

None left to sacrifice, we've sucked our planet dry
Just simple ignorance, you ask, the lie
Who cares about the world, exploit it til it's lost
Who ever stopped to think - our cost

Eliminate, our legacy
Free to desecrate

Lead 1: Fredrik
Lead 2: DanielI am your captain follow me to the gates of Hell 
Battle beckons at the River Somme where corpses swell 

River of blood flow over me 
Show me the beauty of Death 
Fallen Angels teach me your secrets 
Show me forbidden ways 

All that I asked for was given to me 
In a gold plated puzzle box, lovely to see 
I fondled each feature, it began to transform 
When secret portals to the darkness were born 

(The suffering of strangers, the agony of friends 
There is a secret song at the center of the world 
and its sound is like razors through flesh!) 

Oh, what pleasure, delicious pain! 
To the brink and far beyond 
As I felt the nails sink deep into my skull 
Memories of former days were gone 

I rose to a new position, the High Priest of Hell! 

A foul cry molests the air as the demon roams the earth 
The puzzle box a seductive snare for the man who seeks his worth 
The Lamentation Configuration sends its message to all 
A young rogue by the name of Frank received its lovely call 

"We bid you welcome! Come know the joys of Hell!" 

(Pater noster, qui es in Inferis ritibus nomen tuum 
Et priapo est, de scorto sugit nectar 
Ex tumore pulsans malleus hominem 
Virgo in utero ejus nubilem ac discerptum, 
Dolens prava in ecstasim!) 

Larry loves Julia but Julia loves Frank 
She longs to feel his manly touch 
The blood of victims brings him back to her 

Lovely and young, fresh as the dawn 
Kirsty arrives to comfort her father 

She never trusted Julia 
Cold and distant, Julia 
Not like her mother, Julia 
Hurting her father, Julia 
Loving another, Julia 
Daddy's own brother, Julia 
Where are you going? 
Julia, what are you doing? 

Kirsty opened the puzzle box 
Cenobites arrived 
They long to show her the joys of Hell 
She wants to stay alive 

Come Mr. Hell Priest, have I got a deal for you 
Someone escaped your torment 
A degenerate deviant, I can lead you straight to him 
So take him back to Hell!Night falls
The kill calls
You're gonna kill me while I sleep tonight

You're on your own
You cut the phone
You're going to give me such a terrible fright

You're in my room
My living tomb
You raise the knife to stab me in the head

You plunge it in
Through bone and skin
Tonight you've come to take away my life

Drink my blood
Life taker
Eat my flesh
Life taker
Tie me up
Life taker
Take my life

Blood on the bedroom walls
My blood is all over your clothes
My blood is all over the placePlanetarium of burning cells, Disorder

Vengeance Declaration

Holocaust shellshock
Raised rifles in hands with gasfires nearby
Marking the trenches with the Final Sollution

Vengeance Declaration

Forming a fear of strength
Trenches drenched in mud
Mass graves in all the camps
Call extermination to them all

WARFARE WAS CREATED BY REVENGE

To damage and slaughter
Four million gone and strength for another to go
This is the final declaration to slaughter the foes(Instrumental)(Instrumental)This is where I'll cut you down
This is where you're gonna fall

This is how I'm gonna break you
Now you take your final breath

This is where I'll cut you down
This is where you're gonna fall

And I will take your final breath

Timeless fields of suffering
A state of total soul drained coma
Stained domain of silence
Even for those who are dead

Ending of that which could not exist
And all that remains is the dust of my enemies
Where I walk now in silence...
Profound, not ignorant towards 
anything that was done
I conceal my knowladge deep within me 
And the search goes on
(The) beginning of the end
Regardless of all the pleasures of this world
I step back in that timeless domain
Where the dust of my enemies lies
Beneath me
and I walk now, again
Ascendant
In silence

This is where I'll cut you down
This is where you're gonna fall

This is how I'm gonna break you
Now you take your final breath

This is where I'll cut you down
This is where you're gonna fall

And I will take your final breathI hear my soul
I hear her tears
I drowned out her pain
It's my hell, my hell

I want to be a thief
I want to curse you
I want to hate you
hate you, hate you

Look down and to down and to do...
Look down, I want to lie with you
Pray stronger and stronger for us
Give me your hand and trust

We look at the stars, they are far away from us, we can not reach them by hand,
but your hand is in my hand
We can not fly into the Milky Way or Black Eye, but we can fly to our hearts,
cause my heart is in your heart

"God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them" (1 Jn. 4:16) Amen

"I have seen all the things
that are done under the sun;
all of them are meaningless,

I hear, and your soul
I torment my flesh.
I do not want to go
to hell, to hell

I want to be a saint
I want to bless you
I want to love you
Love you, love you


Look down and to down and to do...
Look down, I want to lie with you
Pray stronger and stronger for us
Give me your hand and trust

A hailstorm of bombshells
Scorches the skin of the earth
Like thunder tearing through the soil
Creating chaos and breeding turmoil

Glory in death - End humanity
Glory in death - Celebration of absurdity

A hailstorm of bombshells
Scorches the skin of the earth
Like thunder tearing through the soil
Creating chaos and breeding turmoil

We are an infection spreading
And we will not be stopped
Leaving nothing behind but ash and dust
Destroying all utopian hope

Destroying all utopian hope
No point in mourning the dead
The numbers will rise, and rise again
Until this cancer has been erased
This misanthropic vision will cease to desist
Forward into oblivion
Forward into oblivion

Excruciation and corruption
Cessation and purulence

Glory in death - End humanity
Glory in death - Celebration of absurdity

Complete genocide of mankind
Through mass self-immolation(Instrumental)When I get to die I will never doubt 
'Cause nobody there's going to fuck me out. 
I know dope will fix me well, 
'cause i got it quickly at the gates of hell!

Life is mayhem, gash of a dream. 
Realms of silent peace welcome you in sin: 
You're failed, you're rotted, mentally slaughtered 
Disowned by none, the inner peace has begun. 

Chorus:;
Dig the crust 
Trust me: we live as dust 
Collapse-realize 
Come unstuck from human nature 
'cause if there's no luck 
they have to mock up a paper god. 
Civilisation is a flop. 
My mind drowns in the grains of 
A fateful sandstorm. From the void 
I sing the oblivion this is my "goatspel"! 

[Solo]

Decomposing shadow's done, delete the wrong 
Disturbed representation of this annihilated world 
No more confusion. Senses as a union 
Reality collapses, forever detached 

Relationships cracked, nothing is a fact 
Who needs memory when lies in a cemetery? 
You sing illusion, we broke confusion:
A violent blast, WarstorM come fast!

ChorusBow to me faithfully
Build the church
And i will give you hope
I'll lead you through
The path of my existence
I'll lead you as a creator of hope
Let's join into couples,
Let's create power
Let's generate a new being
Let's create Half-God, Half-Man
The legend of the great
Let the day come
The day when all dominant
And powerful will reign again
And rule where
The first set their steps
The time of the contemporary
Has come to an end,
Efface Yourself
This species is rotting
From the inside,
I give you the choice
Don't be stupid!
They will grant you existence
But efface yourself(Instrumental)("Captain's log:

Fragments of time swirling and twisting, sublime ramparts of existing scenes 
Played out before my eyes then torn from my sight shrieking screams, 
illuminating thoughts and dreams 

As reality peels away 
I no longer know this place or date 
Entering a world lost to humanity 
Dwelling in my own absurdity. 

Listen to my insanity 
Grand delusions of actuality 
Let me place this fear in you 
So you feel the pain I go through 

Haunted every minute not knowing if I'm alive, inescapable despair and pleasure through cataclysmic fears 

Haunted every minute not knowing if I'm alive, inescapable despair and pleasure through cataclysmic fears 

Here I experience love and hate 
Each door I open changes my fate 
Emotionally distraught ending ties with your lot. 
Envying your existence. 
Lost in my partitions. 

Fantastic visions, terrifying aural transmissions 
A voice that soothes my wounds, 
Surging through me, it cracks and booms 
Destroying myself on every plane 
As I eat my own shame[Spoken word and inserts](Instrumental)(Instrumental)Key to eternity does not exist
Way to stay alive disappears
We are only programmed beasts
Without right to immortality

Where is our key to the Universe?
Where is our key to the Universe?
Where is our key to the Universe?
Where is our key to the Universe?

Now our limited minds
Can see only nothingness
Waiting for oblivion
We are falling into the void - into the void

Where is our key to the Universe?
Where is our key to the Universe?
Where is our key to the Universe?
Where is our key to the Universe?

They were friends since childhood, 
the boy used to paint the girls eyes and kiss her blind. 

Girl killed the boy.A destiny we all share against our will
A stinking lie beneath our feet
A dogma a doctrine unreachable
A halo - without a head

Uncover the face of our reality
In it's full uglyness
Erase all signs of restriction
The cruel merciless masterplan

There ain't no glory within these damned shores
And yet an aureole surrounds the knowing
Little lights in the dark
Sometimes melting sometimes they just fade by a single touch

Like the needle of a copass
That trembles shortly
Just to point back to north
The same life is lived again and again
The same life is lived again and again

Breach the circle of the uniformed
Darkness there and nothing more
Pointless faceless scum
Stay aloof - from the filth

Uncover the face of our reality
In it's full uglyness
Erase all signs of restriction
The cruel merciless masterplan

There ain't no glory within these damned shores
And yet an aureole surrounds the knowing(Instrumental)Little puppies and pussycats
Emerald caves with plastic bats

Golden showers and silver fountains
Magick forests under cemetery mountains

Sleepless nights and days of bore
Seven tiny men adoring an aryan whore

The president's semen rotting in a jar
The homecoming queen hit by a car

From abortion straight to rebirth
Holiday seasons in the hollow earth

Overwhelm me, black sorrow
White veils fall the day after tomorrow

(Intro taken from "Black Horse", a song written and performed by S.O.P.O. in 1985.)Take them forward, show them hell. As long as they feel the torture we have done our job. Put them in line, drag them through rocks and fire. This is our land and we'll make them suffer. One million warriors who fear not death are armed to fight. Artillery is brought in. Another holocaust begins. The night sky is lit by fire as they die. We'll take them to the pits - the pits where they'll rot and die. Their children will be taken next and thrown into the fire. Something must feed us. Bodies cut and burned and destroyed; they litter our battlefield, though we see it as decoration. This war is eternal and we will hail victory always. Hail victory always. Hail victory always. Forget the system of peace. 

Now for a thousand years this land has been ours. All inferior life was enslaved or killed. Their termination and utilization allowed our empire to rise. We now rule with terror and violence. Tyranny is the order... a giant cult, which the leader commands.  Until the end of time this empire breathes. Until the end of time this empire breathes.I am the cure to humanity
A flawless will to destroy
Built on lucid hate
Born to achieve my fate

Infect and terminate
One goal: annihilate
Compulsive extermination

I have mercy for none
Blessed by death itself
Magnificient and out of reach
I am your hell

The transcendance
Through deshumanization
Is the one sought
After condition
This momentum
Beyond any control
A brilliant experience
For oneself
I have reached the essence
Of my existenceEnthralled into the dustwind
Crusaders of a lost battle
Warned by a thorn of war
Jeweled in their own blood

Yarns of fugitive elements
In distance to the thorncastle
Empire bricks thrown to the soil
Sharp and poisonous thorns

Pure it is, like defenseless spring births
Unpleased by a sudden nightfall
Turned its back on love and life
And made it all unpure

Lovesongs of the dove, seen through
Time of what he song
A messenger of the nourishing light
Were attacked of enemy ravens
So therefore, it song no more

Pearlgate servants, in the end you gather
In the clouds beyond clouds
Foundation walls of the raising temple
Prisoners of a time that was

Promised sentences long before years
Came to join the hearse that rode
And will always ride
In the hearts of them, historical plagueWatching a horror movie
Makes me feel groovy
But that's not enough
I need the real stuff

The secret I hide
Deep deep inside
Drives me insane
I need real pain

Chainsaw Massacre

Passing through the door
Searching for my saw
With this lovely tool
In my hand I'll rule

Now I'll be your doom
Creeping through your room
Sawing off your head
While you lie in bed

Chainsaw Massacre

Now my work is done
And I've had my fun
Back at my flat
I feel so sad

Another video
My lust starts to grow
How the rest would go
I think you know

Chainsaw MassacreCold and strict, never going astray
Knowing no mercy nor cruelty
Frozen majesty in frozen throne room
Never changing
You cannot hide

Tombs are prepared for the images of man
Their golden faces hiding their hollow composition
Infested with putrid vermin
And filth collected in aeons

The point where oppositions collide
And form where they are born
Unknown it shall always remain
Far from the reach of man's mind

Not one word can be uttered
Not one crime can be committed
Forever alone everything stands
The murderer and the murderedBelow the shallow sky 
The goat does deny 

Flickering stones ignite 
Gruesome yet obliged 
Black lava erupts, it coats	
Yet cold absorbs 

Might and willow breeze 
For only that is dead, I see 

Touch the fire 
I do not burn 
Higher and higher 
I reach the goal 

Further I roam these halls 
Compelled again to serve His will(Instrumental)Psycho slut, evil cunt
kill the worms for her lust
in the night, a sick mind
beyond the flesh only death
parasite- slaughtered lives
infected blood- Homicide
Perversion, a necrohell
hear the cries of despair
left to rot and burned alive
the scum eats your mind...
psycho slut in the night
no escape, none survives
bloody cunt- fetish bitch
in disgust, spreading death
see the blood in her eyes
she will suck all your life
rotten flesh in your hands
terrorize 'till you die 
every night you feast in blood
breed the scum you feed upon

EAT ALL THEIR GUTS- PSYCHO SLUT, PSYCHO SLUT
SLICE ALL THEIR THROATS- PSYCHO SLUT, PSYCHO SLUT
KILL AS YOU FUCK- PSYCHO SLUT, PSYCHO SLUTAt the dawn of time when the Earth was young
A battle was wildly raging
The reign of Cronos fell down to pieces
by Tytan's rage he was dethroned

Under Zeus' leadership the victory was reached
In the gloomy depths
of Tartaros the tyrant was exiled

Then only wastelands and silent valleys
were left where life once dwelled
By clay and fire Prometheus created
the first man while Zeus breathed
the life into him

From the sacred hands of Gods
humanity was born
But their souls were not complete yet
'cause fear possessed Zeus' thoughts

Prometheus couldn't bear Zeus arrogance
[Prometheus:] "Mankind deserves more, they need our help!"
but the father of Gods just made his choice
[Zeus:] "I don't want them to threaten me, one day!
This mortal breed must remain as weak as the animals they are!"

So, Prometheus understood there was nothing more to do
The time for wise words comes to an end
And he decided...

To give mankind a hope
He stole the fire from
The chariot of the Sun

A spark was hidden in a hollow wood
The fire changed man's doom
But horrible was Prometheus' fate
When from the sky
Zeus saw the flames burning bright

To a column he was chained on the Caucasus peak
By Efestus he was trapped,
Tormented by an eagle's jawsThis thirst for hidden knowledge 
encoded in blood 
How shall I choose to respond? 
With fear or wonder and awe 
My path grows increasingly clear 
  Thee I invoke the Lord of the Storms 
  Thee I invoke the Lady of Victory 
  I am he who has foreknowledge 
  Empowered by darkness, discerning clearly 
Aspire to this within and beyond me 
A spark at the core of my being 
Kindles a Flame burning Black in my heart 
The Way of Becoming unfolds 
  Thee I invoke the Lord of the Storms 
  Thee I invoke the Lady of Victory 
  I am he who destroys illusion 
  Empowered by darkness, I Come Into Being 
Through this struggle we Become 
Fate overcome, eternal Self 
I have entered the Hidden Place 
There I hold converse with Set 
  Thee I invoke the Lord of the Storms 
  I am he who holds dominion 
  Empowered by darkness, sovereign of Self 
  The sun shall not rise on the Setian Empire 
 Thee I invoke the Lady of Victory 
 I am he who Xnum protects 
 Empowered by darkness, beloved of Set 
 Obscurity flees from my mind's eye at once 
 I am he who has foreknowledge 
 The Way of Becoming unfolds 
 I am he who destroys illusion 
 Empowered by darkness, I come into BeingYears of silence without any hope
For life has seemed to forget (about) me
No wasted tears, only grief for the past
Though I long for fortune to come

Falling down
Falling away from the underground
Fade away, searching for something to hide astray

Kneeling down
Into denial for what's to come
Or what has been before

Take me back home, bring me to where all ends...(Instrumental)Growing up I was a kid when I first heard
The sound of metal, I have found what i prefered
Chasing a dream so I would grow up just the same
Nothing changed my plans will not be rearranged

But times have changed so I've been told
But I am never letting go
To what has risen in my soul
This love I feel will not outgrow

I live for heavy metal and that just what I do
No time can ever change me, age to date, I refuse
If not for heavy metal would I know what to do
No one can ever take me, this will forever be consoled

Harder then rock their is a sound you can't put down
Tearing through the screams it's gripping marshall sound
Cletched within these bonds hold strong inside of me
This very fire I now introduce to thy

But times have changed so I've been told
But I am never letting go
To what has risen in my soul
This love I feel will not outgrow

I live for heavy metal and that just what I do
No time can ever change me, age to date, I refuse
If not for heavy metal would I know what to do
No one can ever take me, this will forever be consoled

This is not soaked in you can change so easily
It means more then life to me
Its in our hearts, forever lives, will always be
Are right to chose will never lose
This love we feel now will consume

I live for heavy metal and that just what I do
No time can ever change me, age to date, I refuse
If not for heavy metal would I know what to do
No one can ever take me, this will forever be consoledPutrefying remains Make me regurgitate The blood I have consumed The corpse is now left dry The scene is grotesque The fumes of the rot Start to turn me on A sick pleasure... In disembowelling! I live through the dead A grotesque aberration An undead beast Feasting on flesh! Drenching my hands In your blood My erection is hard A clump of meat Lies before me A human being It once was I live for the gore! I live through the dead A grotesque aberration An undead beast Feasting on flesh!I'm a piece of shit 
And I smell like death 
I don't believe 
And I can not feel 

I'm a fucking whore 
In every way 
Don't look at me 
I don't exist 

Passed the point 
Of no return 
Now I see 
Life is death 

You're dead to me 
But I wanna fuck you 
You're just like me 
And I don't love you 

I'm an empty space 
Falling down 
Losing it all 
Disintegrating 

I am dead 
I'm gone 
I'm gone 

I am broken 
I'm lost 
I'm lost 

Now I see 
Life is death 
Life is death(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Stronger than reason
Known since the dawn of time
Hidden in shadows
Of human consciousness

It sees no boundaries
Inborn in human hearts
So self-renewing
In Ouroborus forms

Coming forth in grim waves
To drown lives
Flaming darkness ripping through
Blackened skies
From the cradle to the grave
It lives on
From the father to his son
It won't be gone

"One has to be cruel,
In order to be kind"
said the devious shepherd
To his herd so blind

Come join the dance of chaos
The piper's summoning his choir

Eternal Evil,
Eternal Evil,

There will be evil
As long as mankind lives
There will be conflicts
As long as leaders preach

Hatred and violence
Wrapped up in peaceful words
There's no salvation
In this cold, tortured world

Like an ever blowing wind
Sneaking through
Centuries whose pages are
Inked in blood
From the cradle to the grave
Across the land
From the father to his son
It knows no end...Central moon static silence spectral light necromorphic dreams
All about this happened in delirious forest pulsional stage she eliminate me with pleasures and death unsurreal world
I listened to a could voice and let me static that wet smell whic raise with nocturnal visions that causes my fear 
I feel my death penetrating at nightfall those things her beauty...Urgh

Damned beyond all space and time
Wretched deform
Shadows cast by dying men
Beyond the realms of light
Their black hearts know only hate
Scorn disgust
With cold hands they come for you
To bring you into these

Demonic dreams, abnormal screams
Phantasmal pain that haunts you so
They know you they hate you
They choke you, sink claws into flesh

I heard them calling out my name
And I now see through dead eyes
Now all I seek is to feed
To feel the warmth of skin
I saw them rise in visions of the darkness that will come

Rargh

Now you die, your life is lost
So we take your soul with us
Dripping, seeing, through the soil
To our realm below the earth

Raheeeeeeeer

Tell me of the dreams of the dead
Tell me of the dreams of the dead
Tell me of vengeance, nightmares horrendous
Tell me of the dreams of the dead

Demonic dreams, abnormal screams
Phantasmal pain that haunts you so
We know you, we hate you
We choke you, sink claws into flesh

Now you die, your life is lost
So we take your soul with us
Dripping, seeing, through the soil
To our realm below the earth

I was born an abomination 
Repulsive pile of sickness 
Wailing contamination 
Deeply attached to sadness 
Addicted to attention 

I can't believe I managed to stay so long without you 
The day you left I felt I lost the most of my soul 
The memory of our days is hazy like a distant dream 
What lies ahead is just trying to keep your light from dyingI shall tear down the world
Make temples of worship
In honour of our Lords

Invoke the mighty serpent
The formed and formless one
Call forth the raging darkness
Under the trident sign

Summoning winds
From the abyss

Tiamat - architect of chaos
Through un-creation I am born

To rise in furious wrath
Becoming one with thee

Rites of illuminated death

Unlock the hidden gates
The gates beyond the dark

Invoke through temple prayer
The boundless dragon God
With eyes of burning fire
I ascend

Rites of illuminated death

As above so below
The serpents breath weaves
Through hidden realms
Beyond death

I have become as one...
With the God of death

Invoked through ritual chaos
Ceremonial darkness born
Omega calls to thee
Descend!The venom and rapture of the earth. 
There is great danger here. 
Transform. 
From the red throat of the abattoir 
the true depths of madness come. 
The solemn words of absence 
and the remnants of the past 
coalesce into the bleak reality that lays before us all. 
The gates ripped asunder, 
unleashing the wrath contained. 

The claret rain, brushed red by the hands of your maker. 
Transform. 

The rite. Forever. 
Immaculate defamation of self. 
Let us come together in immolation. 

Coaxed into the shelter of reality. The pride before the fall, 
The weight of this rejection 
crushing us one and all.Aim is to make you slaves
Till our last day
Responsible for all mistakes

I reject authorities
And I don't care at all
I have got my own head
Watch your idols fall

And if you do not change this world, nobody will
We all can make false authorities retreat

It's time for painful defloration

break it all

funneled abyss narrows down in fogs of exhaust as winds whip vengeance for convenience, not for a lack of disagreements. there's not much left to chase and fewer things to fight for, born into a losing war where the battlefields have already been sewn with seeds of misconception and deceit. and this shit ain't folk and we'll never be lovely so i'll scream until i die because it's cheaper than therapy. i don't understand how you can claim to be a spiritual man, if you believe that god created the land why wouldn't you protect it with everything you have. 
"and i brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy it's fruits and it's good things, but you defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination.-- the fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth, every bird of the sky, with everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of he sea.--look at the birds in the air that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet they are fed." 
when you suffer for it in this life 
that doesn't mean it's right and when you enforce destructive ideas for wealth 
i care nothing for your life. 
you're in your circles running around blinded to real life with coins on your eyes 
we wont get another try in another lifeThe Masses gather for another look
At the one who lays in the crypt
His eyes are closed
His arms are crossed

Never again...
Never again...
To walk this earth...
To walk this earth...

His worth was known
To all mankind
Things he did
And all to soon
He met with death
Before the rising of the moon...

Grieve no longer
He would have said
To all the people around his grave
I'll be waiting for all of you
On the other side from you I cannot hide.At the longest fullmoon night
In the castle near the forest
Where the howling of wild wolves
Sounds like music of dark abyss
At midnight wind was blowing
Transylvanian snow was falling
From the bloody womb of woman
Son of dragon was born
Mystic howling in the forest
Spreads the sacred words of evil
"Thou art. Lord of Wallachia,
Thou shalt be the Dracula..."
May this night be eternal
As eternal as his soul
The man with satanic spirits
Became horrified ruler...
By the fire and sword
By the fear and terror
Like wolf thirsty for blood
Vlad destroyed his enemies...
They called him impaler
And they lived in fear
"Blood is life" he said,
And he killed them to live again...
And the night of end has come
They were waiting for his death
Three nights later grave was empty
Vlad became the higher form!
"I am nightmare, warrior spirit
From the house of dead I come
I am darkest force of night
Bloodlust covered my mind..."(Instrumental)Louisa has the highest population of A.I.D.S.!

The earth is bleeding while man is still proceeding
The everlasting insanity

Experiments done is secrecy
By sadistic criminal industry
A sinister warfare with bacterias
Soon the hell is upon us

Poisonous streams of radiation
Violent storms of devastation
Intoxication of the planet
Destroy the living organisms(Instrumental)(Instrumental)In those insane, and yet familiar places, where death lies beckoning.
It is the unseen, of metaphysical nature, That pierces through, beneath the veil.


Rise - Eu Daimon


Face to face - with one and the many, the terrible truth of rememberance.
For the horned god, of infinite seed, Read into platonic verses.

Rise - Eu DaimonHail, Brother !
Hail, Sister !
Today we are drinking
To the forgotten times !
Today we are drinking
To the forgotten Gods !
To valour & honour !
To the forgotten Code !
Today we are drinking
To the forgotten Tales !
You Shall hear hundreds !
Today we are drinking
To those who have never been !
Hail ! 
Hail, Brother !
Hail, Sister !
Raise you chalice !
The down is breaking !
And you are given not tranquility,
But SWORD !!!(Instrumental)Every day I look deep inside, 
My mind trying hard to find, 
Something wrong, something right, 
But I can't and I know that, 
In every fuckin' minute of my life, 
My innerself is going blind, 
Now I know, do not strife again, 

Satan gives you 666 to start the war, 
Satan gives you 666 to break the door, 
Satan gives you 666 so you can finally find, 
What you've been looking for, 

Every night I think 'bout him now, 
Something tells me not to bow, 
There are voices in my head, 
And they're starting to grow, 
In every fuckin' moment of this shit, 
I can't just simply quit, 
My soul, burning with hell's fire, 

And I know, Satan is, nothing but wrong, 
But I want, to be wrong, Ave 666,Motion of bodies
Tied in clusters
Flow of thoughts above and inside
Concrete
Torrents of hours, night and day
Down to dusk

Glimpses of genius
Hours of fear
Decades of embarrassment

From 9 AM to
And this time it's
"You know, I really..."
Too late, too fast, to soon

Ideas of no shape
Still, inborn, beautiful
Conceived yet unfinished
Theoretically perfect

This is our time
Endless but suprisingly
FiniteI will be the next 
I will take your power 
I will rise the slept 
Knowledge of your fire 
Vama Marg! 
We all walk through you 
Vama Marg! 
We all know your truth 
Forest of my land 
Blessed by your fire 
Lightning , your command 
Pleasure, your desire 
Vama Marg! 
We all walk through you 
Vama Marg! 
We all know your truth 
Dono Nobis Scientiam 
Oh! Baphometh 
Solve et Coagula 
Oh! Baphometh 
Burning pentagram 
Enclose me as I dream 
Mithra take my hand 
And rule my destinyFear demonic force
striken by tortures of death
she has no fuckin' remorse
slaughtered in pain by the dead

Drown into the absurd
fear her evil spells
possessed by living death

Die in Hell...
Deathwitch Possession!!!

Unspeakable evil penetrates your soul
you won't escape, it's time to face your doom

Like a plague she kills from within
silent, slowly with evil and sinTo gods of war
To gods of death
A sacrifice we offer you
Three black hearts
Who walk the earth
Your bidding is what we do
Collecting souls
For experiments

Can your system sustain this?
Mutant germs
Coursing through your veins
You won't believe what manifests

We offer death, disease, mutation, annihilation
We'll give you death, disease, mutation, annihilation
We'll bring you death, disease, mutation, annihilation
Our gift is death, disease, mutation, annihilation

To mix and match
Human artifacts
Attempting to mutate beast and man
Can one create such a mutant race?
Of mythological design

A pinch of this
A touch of that
It's crude but it should do the job
The rising of such a hybrid race
Not quite what your god had in mind(Instrumental)Dead mountains
Dead lakes
Dead caves
Dead rivers

Dead lanscapes
Dead skies
Dead trees
Dead universeKneel in front of me, my son you have sinned
It will cost you plenty of pain
Oh! You're scared a bit of me!
It gives me the force and the power to live!
I, I don't feel down at all!
it was the day when I became your god
Kneel in front of me, useless whore
My knife is at your face, I'm binding the rope
So give me just one reason, why I should spare you
'Cause I know I want to be covered in your blood
And I, I don't feel down at all!
it was the day when I became your god
You constructed all your life by building it on faith
After all you live in mental ruins and hypocrisy
Now I, I don't feel down at all!
It was the day when I became your god
You called yourself the stronger one
Now you kneel in front of me
And all I do is laugh at you!
You constructed all your life by building it on faith
After all you live in mental ruins and hypocrisyCan you reach this far my Lord and rescue me
From this sin so enslaving
My lifes a trainwreck
Without You I have no control
Never a moments rest surrounded by this turmoil
You know my will is strong
But my flesh is weak
And if i'd forgive myself I know that You would forgive me

(Chorus)
I want to finally be free
Altar calling calling me
And with Your strength this time
I'll make a final stand
To repent and actually change

Can You heal this broken heart and tortured mind
And help me leave the past behind
Nightmares return sometimes to remind me of the pain
I'd like to say i'll never make thaose same mistakes again
Back slidden into the grey
No more black than white
The life I lead will never change
Until I start living right

(Repeat chorus)
In the shadows I remain
In the shadows growing wings
(Solo)

I know the path for me is already paved
Only through Jesus Christ can my soul be saved.I ride the whore
Pure nocturnal rome
My destiny

I drift away, far away
From light to unknown places

Fraught with energy
Pure nocturnal rome
I lose reality

Through the pines i saw the nymphs
A magic circle, so svelte and pure
Dancing rituals for the gods
Through the light and shadow

I am away, far away
From the presence of reality

Winds carrying screams from the palatine
Like words of wisdom and fatality
Real or not, this becomes the essence of the manifest

I ride the whore
Pure nocturnal rome
My destiny

Entering the place of sacrifices 
Where blood bleached its way to awe
Nourishing the gods of war

I walk away, far away
Through the night and mystic placesThrough storms of devilry and firenight
the world is scorched and prepared for hell
the nocturnal lords of the dark moon hordes
gather is force with power of death unveiled
Oh such is the great secret that transcends
oh such is the ways of the mages and wizards
they arise to such heights beyond comprehension
plot their command of this earthly realm

legions of the one beyond the ancient time
legions amass the nether worlds and wait
arise they shall by the oath of blood command
call forth legions of belial arise

As it is and was and shall be forever
the beings beyond flesh shall triumph and lord
in stars and planets they abide awaiting
their form formless energy unfolds
together they are all and all is in them
limits of brain constrain the mind
calling their names the wind does always
they heed the commands and prepare to ariseThey are everywhere and always there
At anytime and anywhere
They don't foul up Never!
They know everything about everyone
They know everything about you
Everyone knows and fears them
They are the untouchables
Don't ever cross with them
If you do, you'll be the next one
Chorus:
Big city sharks their shadows aren't just in the city
Big city sharks they'll find your weakness too
Big city sharks straight thinkers always right
Big city sharks they'll show you your facts too
So strong everyone astounded
So stupid everyone's screaming
So smart and perfectly gifted
That they only cry when they're alone
Chorus
Hey shark who but you loves you?
Hey shark there is one you don't love him
Hey shark you can't fool him
Hey shark don't forget that you are not God!
They drive better whatever that means
They love much better however that goes
Someday you'll see their weaknesses too
cause one day they'll stand before God too.
Chorus(Instrumental)Take my hand and we'll go back home.
Oh, take my hand and you'll see that whatever happened is not a problem now.
It's no longer an issue that holds any weight.
Just come on, it's not far from here now.

The way you look at me shows you're not so ready, but time will tell and words will say that we're better off now.
Let's leave while it's early and we haven't been gone too long.

We went too far than we needed but now we can change that,
we still have what matters to us the most. We can't say anything we
haven't already.
They'll always look at us differently, but we're different anyways.
I know that much.(Instrumental)Unleash the Butchered Masses
Their brains sealed in bottles and glasses
Unleash their crippled carcasses
Reanimate the undying

Sew their mouths and eyes
For they must not see and speak

Unleash the Butchered and Crippled Masses

Have you ever been crushed by a 10 ton hammer?
Pure Metal strikes and no grass will grow
Fuckin taste your last breath and say your final prayers
Devastating the state of mind devouring the devasted
The Devastation

Cut out their guts
For they will be fed by hatred
They will be fed by hatred

Unleash the Butchered and Crippled Masses

Let us be their tongue and eyesRise... Pagan Ones
Rise... Satans Sons
Rise... Shields and Swords
Rise... Sounds of War

Destroy realms of Light
Burning heavens throne
Reigning ancient ways
New world here to stay

Satan lives, Satan lives, Satan lives, Satan lives

Rise... Red Eye Beast
Rise... Lord of Night
Rise...Fullmoon God
Rise... Black Abyss

Open Seven Gates
Stand high knowledge ones
Fire summons thee
We are the new breed

Satan lives, Satan lives, Satan lives, Satan lives.

Legions marching
War Drums beating
Weapons striking
Christians falling
New World reigning
Pagan Victory

In the name of Satan, Lucifer and Baal
Hail the ancient and their mighty realm
I raise the torches flaming high above
Lord of Nature I worship theeI love the looks they make
Upon their faces, cringing and crawling away
Into the night I feast upon the flesh of man
Gripping ripping and gnawing away
Feeling my sanity decay

The moon pierces the sky
Transforming my flesh to this beast
My thirst grows
Gathering for this gruesome feast

The moonlight calls to me, evolves inside of me
As I transform into this creature deep within
This curse that passed to me shall plague you all
This midnight massacre will kill you all

I love the looks they make
Upon their faces, cringing and crawling away
Decay

And through the night and darkness
I consume everything in sight
Sinking my teeth into the weak and lesser man

The blood that runs through me
Will now run through you
I am the one that will put an end to you

The fear is running through you
Right down your spine
You'll feel it right before you die
I control you
I am the one and only that controls your soul
I am the god of gods inside
And you'll die when I die...

And through the night and darkness
I consume everything in sight
Sinking my teeth into the weak and lesser man

I love the looks they make
Upon their faces, cringing and crawling away
Into the night I feast upon the flesh of man
Gripping ripping and gnawing away
Feeling my sanity decay

The moonlight calls to me, evolves inside of me
As I transform into this creature deep within
This curse that passed to me shall plague you all
This midnight massacre will kill you allLurking, a suspicion, that you're not who you may seem
Disguising your feelings, you're preparing to deceive
Waiting for the moment that your actions will go unseen

No one will trust you, anymore
Your second chance is gone
No one will trust you, anymore
The damage has been done

How many times is it now, have you failed everyone?
Over and over and over you lie to us all

How do you live on as this poisonous wretch?
Living as if everyone owes you a debt
Your sanity deteriorates, now you fall to your knees
If I beheld the power of judgement
I'd leave your body to the fleas

Your treachery will haunt you for the rest of your years
Alone and loveless, just you and your fears
Hear me now and hear me clear,
You've begun to live your coldest years!

The coldest years will bring the end for you
Like the wilting of a rose your soul has turned to black
Forbidden secrets have unveiled themselves
I can't forgive how you betrayed your word

(You can live on like nothing ever happened...You can
walk away with nothing more than a memory)

But if the world has different plans for you
Then I'm saddened that your fate wasn't by my hand
Your suffering is certain, it's the writing on the wall
Into the depths of hell you go, you reap what you sew

Covered by the blood of the demons that you've spawned
Taste the darkest red, spit at those you've wronged
All of those you knew, left you in their past
In a dismal trail of tears, you live your coldest yearsOn your pathetic fairy tale I spit and fuck off / I shall destroy my flesh if it refuses to wear the armor of scarz / I shall destroy my eyes if the ignore the disfigured weakness/ Day by day I get more filth? / I cast myselt into abomination and eat shit to live / Debris broken into pieces reign this undying darkness / Naked wounds shall be the blind whore for my razor / I woner what mde this yaerning still wish to dream / Slay the ghosts of the past / Hang them high /  Total destruktive arising / Your sickening ideal is tragically swallowed by the raging void of the severe reality I am now facing / Those left after the unavoidable genocide are piles of dead rats as far as eye can see / Nothingness turns out to be evil and proklaims the Satanik viktory / Never forget any pain / They will tell of time to arise /(Instrumental)agama tanpa pembebasan, ajaran penuh pembodohan

From the East they have come, wicked servants of death
They?ve surrounded the plain and approached city gate
They?re digging the trenches and fortify holy ground
Preparations for the siege! They?ll be grinding us down!
II.
Catapults are ready and the firing begins
They shoot over the walls! You know what it means?!
The fire brakes out, the danger is real!
The heads of our slain! You know what we feel?!
Ref.
We can?t fall back, under attack!
We?re a proud nation!
We?re under siege, they won?t get an inch!
Even if it means our termination!
III.
Denethor is broken, he?s losing his mind
Gandalf is forced to take over command!
Along with Imrahil they?re leading defense
But riders from Rohan are our only chance
Ref.
We can?t fall back, under attack!
We?re a proud nation!
We?re under siege, they won?t get an inch!
Even if it means our termination!
Bridge
IV
Midnight attack, the siege towers creep
They?re charging the gate, we can?t fall asleep!
A battering ram, one hundred feet long
With head of black steel, the beast called Grond!
V
The Master of Nazguls leads himself the attack
Our gate can?t hold for long, it?s about to crack!
He?s waving the spells and spreading the fear
The gate tumbles down, our end is near!
Solo
VI.
The raider in black enters the gate
We are terrified, we see our fate
Only Gandalf ahead, he?s ready to fight
But the raider is laughing; he?s so sure of his might!
solo
VII.
Suddenly dawn cracks out of the clouds
The sound of the horn is ringing out!
The Rohan arrived, black rider retreats
So we or they? Who will suffer defeat?
Ref.
We can?t fall back, under attack!
We?re a proud nation!
We?re under siege, they won?t get an inch! Even if it means our termination!
Ref.
We can?t fall back, under attack!
We?re a proud nation!
We?re under siege, they won?t get an inch!
Even if it means our termination!I raise myself once again through the
Ruins of destruction
And remain still alive
From all of them because only the strongest
Will forever survive
No one can stand in front of me for I need
No one to guide me on my path
I can for always live far from them in
The eternal embrace of nature, where all the
Evils of nature will be my companion
In the majesty of death and immortality
And I will show no mercy
There is no hope for me to stop, I can't
Become a slave to humanity
And no obstacle is in front, I will fight
For all I believe to be and that holds my
Blood strong, and all will fall down to
My legs for hypocrites will always fall.

My pride is strong and you fall in front in
Your helpless struggle to be
Never I could see the beauty of spring 
Because then you were the worthless obstacle
Shaving my vein
And I don't fear anything, for there is nothing to
Fear, if a man cannot fight then lie is not worthy
To be a man

I will for ever be alone in immortality and
No one will ever sleep on this ground
And I will not hear these cries again because I
Will be deaf and blind to all that remained behind

I will never again see the deliverance in your
Glance for glance of yours was too deceiving. 
I found my peace inside of me, the peace you are
Still craving and never will really feel, for you
Don't want that peace.Walking the path of no return 
Lurks the evil that lives within 
Shattered dreams of many men 
Who tried to cross the bridge of sin 

I'm the one who lives to tell the tale 
Of the mythical demon that once impaled 
The murders of many brought fear to the land 
This mythical menace, I will slay in the end 

The Goblin would sit beneath the rocks 
Waiting in the shadows as the bridge was blocked 
As the men would try to break the barricade 
They would witness the Goblins Blade 

It was not a pretty sight to watch them die 
But I was young and I feared for my life 
Their throats were cut at the flick of his wrist 
And as they fell he said with a hiss 

"I'm the keeper of the bridge of souls 
And underneath is where the bloodriver flows 
So never try to cross my path, for if you do 
I'll split you in half" 

The Goblin sits beneath the rocks 
Waiting in the shadows as the bridge was blocked 
As the men would try to break the baracade 
They would witness the Goblins Blade 

Walking the path of no return 
Lurks the evil that lives within 
Shattered dreams of many men 
Who tried to cross the bridge of sin 

I'm the one who lives to tell the tale 
Of the mystical demon that once impaled 
The murders of many brought fear to the land 
This mystical menace, I shall slay in the end 

The power is great within his sword 
And the only way to defeat him 
Is to steal his source, leaving him weak 
I shall show no remorse 
I shall take his last breath, with his own sword(Instrumental)All of god's children are crying
Their holy virgin is raped
We are fucking her anal
Her purity sodomized in heaven
Accept that your churches are burning
In total massive destruction
We are hailing the total
Fucking war in heavenFormless evil
haunting the night
as we slaves of the horned one
to his black eternity
visualize a veil of
blasphemy

From the bottomless pit
to the nocturnal skies above
the whispering voice of death
forces to follow
the black stream of eternity

Overwhelmed
by the world beyond
view colors never seen
drowning in a shape
of the one with the horns
drawn with your ownest blood

The vision strong and pure
eradicates the pain
open the door to the inside
the abyss deep within the skin
as my blood drips to the floor
become a god of negativity

Existence you bound to by life
deny and obey
bound to the sign of the pentagramm
its the circle is the only order
its elements give a form
to shapeless
death comes to pass
born again in satan's embraceI see the candle light burning in your 
eyes, flareing up my eyes in flames 
On this pitch-black summer night 
of passion and pain 

The razor caressed my flesh 
and my arms turned red, I feel a vast desire 
Years of pain are flowing down my arms. 
Sweet, red, warm stream you drink, make me released 
Give me your hand, let me make you feel the ease, 
in the bed of razors we bleed together 

I feel the fire burning in my heart, 
I see it sparkling in your eyes 
The blaze you're feeding more and more 

The razor caressed your flesh and your arms turned red. 
I feel your vast desire 
Tearing pain is flowing down your arms. 
Sweet, red, warm stream I drink to make you released 
Holding your arms, cherish this composure, 
in the bed of razors we sleep together, foreverDark moon in the horizon
A sign of evil returning
Fire that purified millions
Shall be lit again!

Summon the holocaust
Light the black purifying flame
Summon the holocaust
The cleansing fire of Satan's kingdom

The scent of burning human flesh
Nauseating, but so tempting
Purification of a nation
The purest form of annihilation

Summon the holocaust
Light the black purifying flame
Summon the holocaust
The cleansing fire of Satan's kingdom

Summon the holocaust

Burn the christians
...And see their crosses in flames
Burn the jehovah
...Feed the holy ones with gas

Summon the holocaust

Burn the christians
...And see their crosses in flames
Burn the jehovah
...Feed the holy ones with gasCompulsive gambler 
No matter win or lose 
I arrive late at my home
Only my dog waiting 
The bone plate 
Broken bones 
Another night without money
But do not spirit lack
The TV off air 
Cans, clothing and vinyls
Deep sleep in hell 
Tomorrow will be another day
I'll take my boots 
And will run behind some coins
Dream deep in heaven(Instrumental)Our minds are locked in illusion realm
Unable to unearth the truth
Real world hidden far away
Behind the veil of structure

Deconstruction
Recreation
Each perception
Builds a new world

All truths ever known to man
Are nothing but his own creation
Knowledge produced with a hidden purpose
Structures weaved into illusions veil

i start to see things as they are
manipulate the chains that bind my mind
on the path to freedom i realize
nothing is true, everything's permittedThe Dimensionless Monologue

Pt.I: Tedium

Got all he wants... Oh, I pity he...
What am I doing? Oh I question thee...
What am I doing? For this feeling?

It's a lie? It's a lie? 
I...
Oh lord...

Just before you're absolved of guilt...
Doesn't make it right!
An awkward heaving sigh...
But just before you're absolved of guilt...I Bleed Black 
Live a life of doom 
I breathe Black 
Nothing more to do 
Im Bleeding Black 
Black is all I see 
Im Bleeding Black 
Its my destiny 
I walk deep 
In a field of death 
I give all 
till my dying breath 
Im Bleeding Black 
Black is all I see 
Im Bleeding Black 
Its my destiny 
I fight strong 
Forever merciless 
Determined 
Until Im laid to restWalkin' through the graveyard and terror surrounds you
Hear some spooky sounds, you don't know what to do
Fear is all around, corpses dressed in black
The Creeper's comin' and there 'ain't no turnin' back

The Creeper:
"I will be there when your body dies
I will be there through the night
When I come to hold you tight
Please darlin' don't you cry"

Runnin' faster now, you got no time to lose
Chills run down your spine, there's nothin' here for you
You watch in horror as creatures crawl across the graves
Listen closely now and hear The Creeper say..Steadfast and bold, toiling through centuries 
Nameless they are but through us prevail 
Faithful and true, our lives are their gift to us 
Through fire and ice, our ancestors strove 

Our seed spread deep in the soil 
Sown with our own stubborn hands 
To this is our loyalty bound 
Far from wavering lands(Instrumental)I cannot repress the urge anymore 
I must complete this task 

This is my only fucking goal 
I must program the hyperdrive 

Program the hyperdrive 
leave behind 
the megadrive 
it's a thing of the past 
the hyperdrive 
is all of the rage motherfucker 

I'm so fucking tired 
of the megadriveAre you the Devil's creation, a poison?
Transmigrations' circle
Your soul and his transmission
The immortality of a resurrection

Do you wish to die as to be born again ?
Enjoying a new body
Trespassing what divides
Your humanity from your divinity

Being the angel of metamorphosis
Living the Angel's metamorphosis
Living the Angel's metamorphosis
Live this metamorphosis, my Angel

This is how your Perfect dream should be
The might to give several lives
Living several lives in only one, the same one
And then go punished by Gods !

Deep morphogenetic crisis
Infinite seconds with the perfume of eternity
When metamorphosis turns into metempsycosis

Beyond evils
There is only emptiness inside meCold winds of faggothism
Cold winds of faggothism

The wind is blowing, sucking cocks
The fucking faggots are you
I can feel the gayness in the air
it's floating like a pillow

Cold winds of grimness
Cold winds of grimness
Cold winds of grimnessA sea of sulphur embraces the world, and so in man are oceans of venom.

Corrupted was once the blood of Cain, overwhelming fascination,
by his murder hand worshipped, revealed to him the terrifying eye of infinity.
The ground of servitude, profaned!
Anger and its incidence vermilion, nourrish the raging indicible.
Subjugating the blackness of horror
hence cleaves the being like the styx the ground of hell.
Eon...

So in man are oceans of venom

Enslaved hearts, blind to the unbearable, bath in the blood so vile,
but do not dare to taste its flesh.

One god poisonned my veins to black,
One god had carved my heart.Twisting their faith giving, them the light, knowing only blackness awaits them in death 
Filling innocent minds with the stench of their lies, unknowingly summoning the dark masters 
Calling forth a pit of unending abyss 

Torment brought to all like lambs to the slaughter 
Arrival of the dark masters 

Reign of vindication, payment for impiety, sickening savage monarchy, wicked kings of the other, brought forth by the lie of a god. 
false faith conquers all the lands, taking its grasp on the weak minded souls. 

lord of the depths, monarch of the shadow, bringer of the end, 
Watch as they die 

Blackened souls, holding the throne, reaping the flesh, all in the name of a god 

Save us, cure us 
Master 
Feed us, protect us 
SaviorWe are the children of the night
with a passion to the dark side
Our fuel to burn is hate
Damnation our fate

We, as shadows of Satan
Cloaked in black
A haunting presence of evil
Devilous cult of a darker night

An echo of the loud sound
Trembling the foundations of the earth
The enlightening noise
to shatter this reality

We, as shadows of Satan
Cloaked in black
A haunting presence of evil
Devilous cult of a darker night

With the sigil of Satan
we speak His words
And rule the nights
as shadows of SatanSilent Valleys... In remembrance!
The burnt dead bodies
White phosphorous ending
Only death where eyes may see

Unrevealed chemical genocide
Sleeping warriors of winter valleys
Lay victorious in Death

Winter shedding tears upon unknown tombs
Lost martyrs of Tora Bora
Fading memory of dying screams

Diseased life
Perished and forgotten
Journey to unknown dimensions
Lonely graves of Tora Bora

Entombed in nameless mass graves
Death lurks the silent valley

A moment painted in flowing red
Engraved into my memories

.................................

To these mountains I weep
Death plagued memories of Tora Bora
Forlorn resting martyrs
Reflection of pale faces

"Painful death"
"Beautiful death"(Instrumental)Lifequest

When its night
dark outside
nothing or noone catches my sight 

does my life
does your life
do our lives belong to us? 

that's my doubt
but i'm proud
that no answer fits my mind 

they won't let
me believe
that it's so easy 

No
there are no certainties

 
oh
but i'm not sure

 
Be a man,
wake up!damn!
don't you see your life is fear?

 

face the facts,
wake up then,
can't you feel that death is near?

 

Be a man,
wake up!damn!
some nights you have a little doubt

 

face the facts,
wake up then,
how can you escape, my dear?

when its night
dark outside
nothing or noone catches my sight

work all day
pay to play
no this time don't wanna stay

 

search for gold
among the mud
and meanwhile i become old

I sacrificed
my whole life
to a god that makes me blind

no
there are no certainties

oh
but i'm not sure

 

Be a man,
wake up!damn!
don't you see your life is fear?

face the facts,

people charmed by fake
an hidden power reigns
eats my brain like meat
die today but live

 

people charmed by fake
an hidden power reigns
eats my brain like meat
tills my mouth with shit!The solitude that reigns within these walls
Deprives me from any distraction
Therefore, it's Impossible for me to ignore
My conscience icessant murmurs
Telling me about
The ominous atmosphere 
Surrounding this place

I Live as a Prisoner in this cell
Where the weight of boredom crushes me down
And even if every minute seems endless
Under the oppressive mass
Already to much time has been confine
in this sombre uncompleted chapter 
Of my life story

Incarcerated I am, because long ago
My steps would have deviated
from the ideal path to sucess

Yet I have never diverted
From the straight and narrow
Why does the sociey treats me Like a criminal?
Would money as corrupted its definition of sucess

I have simply followed my heart
Without worrying where my steps would lead me
And even if its tracks have led me here
Never will I deny it

Despite the bumpys detours
That have stood up before me
I have the conviction that only my heart
can guide me to prosperity

In the wrong lane are the weak of mind
Who have one day relunctantly rushed toward
The fatest shortest road
Because they believe their dreams were utopian
sooner or later they will realize
that happyness is ephemeral
As the content of their wallet
All that can be bought has a lasting life
But the well-being that follows
from Self-fullfillment  is immortal

Today I pay the price
Of hapiness no money can buy
To acquire it I have to disburse
A lot of patience
I serve the sentence of the dreamer
Tomorrow, justice shall be done
Life will pay me back in kind
since it always welcomes with open arms
The fruits of sincere effortsGateway paintings open at dawn
Paranormal breathe echoes from corners
Through flesh and to eternity

Dead activity return to a 
Poor loved heart without beats
There's not much more down to go down to
Since the backside of the moon
Suck the void out of all the vicious holes

Troubled horizon, hunting season
Dusk swallower, death breeder
Hello clarity, goodbye sanity
Hello mirror me, goodbye obscurity(Instrumental)As you leave me
I feel such loneliness sweep over me
I sense the world getting darker
And the air getting colder
death is haunting these woods
And I can see all those
Whose flesh he will soon touch
He will soon touch...

The fragrance of dying flesh is burning
And slightly overwhelming
As sure as those who protect this forest slowly die
So do the bonds of those who need its air and nourishment
Soon all shall die

All the crying of those dying
Haunts those hunting and those running
Death is creeping on those weeping
There is no chance for those sleeping

Now it's snowing, the winds blowing
There is nothing new now growing
Leaves are falling, bodies sprawling
There's no hope when death comes crawlingBlack sky, white sea
Hills in the fog.
Corpses adorn wall
Of my dull mind.
Rotten insect, faded flowers
Thorns on wrist.
Hope vanish
Like breaking glasses

Darkness in the wind
Going out sun
Cold in the heart
Tears of pain

Obsessions without colour
Blade in my eyes.
Chains around neck
Tearing vein.
Blood cascade
From fertile sky,
Fertile of scourge
With black wings.

Wide open arms
Persecutor eyes
Rotten wings
Torn flesh.

Misery and plagues
Condemned opponents.
Crucified by the madness
Deceived by pious soul.
Supreme empire
Triumph of evil
I was always removed
Now I... DESTROY!FROM THE EASTERN SANDS

OUT OF THE DESERT SLAVES SHALL RISE 
SECTARIAN WORMS OF OLD FAITH

Hail, evil! Hail indestt
Hail screaming forest!Like a wilted flower I die down.
With distorted sensations and in loneliness, my soul decays.
consuming every energy.
Everything is pain. Everything hurts.
I let myself go, one petal after the other falls down
dry and lifeless.
I wither, I strip off of every hope,
wrenched away by a freezing and cruel wind
Dead leaves violently twirl in the air,
submitted to the fury of the upcoming winter.
Nailed to the floor, I observe the heaviness of a gray and
leaving myself being covered by
frozen and ethereal snow.
Snow that brings calmness
Snow that erases everything
Around, every light turns off.
I breathe in deeply a bitter air,
that wounds, that tears the chest apart.
In the dark I feel myself being lifted up by the wind,
and dismembered, I evaporate,
like snow crystals lost
in the eternity of a froistibbten void.Purity is gone paradise is burnt
Sacreligious cries of orgy lacerating the sky
Nymphomaniac maidens masturbate 
Upon the tomb of the decapitated
Vomit forth blasphemy let the blood flow
Ritual rape is practiced before the headless God
Still raping the fucking holiness
Blood and cum the depraved angelz crave
Dead is God
Blood cum SatanDread helm of Edain, ride forth!
Master of fate, mastered by doom
Mormegil, cursed be by Melkor

To brandish the black sword
Is to wield both strength and despair!

Ensnared by orcs, in Angband detained
Tortured in the darkness
Even in rescue, his curse shall prevail

With anglachel, Beleg was slain in the dark

No weapon can unleash thoughts from
The trickery of the great worm,
But for Glaurung's slaying!

Poisoned blood, poisoned minds.

Mighty is the arm beneath gurthang
And mightier still the thrust of the blade
The horrid, scaled belly is pierced!Fear, you will fear me.
Ripped, I'll see you bleed
Fall, onto your knees.
Pray to be freed.
You'll soon become a part of us.
Endure such pain again, and more.
Barbs of rust tear at your flesh.
Can't you control the ecstasy?
Death waits here to embrace you,
Hack your body and rape your soul.
Instruments of the finest degrees.
Blades eager for the taste of the crimson.
This house is a place of evil,
this house is a crypt of pain.
Don't fear it, we enjoy it,
bathe in its bleeding rain.
Your soul is mine for taking,
your mind is not alone.
We'll soon be in there with you,
come join our happy home.
You'll soon become a part of us,
endure such pain again, and more.
Barbs of rust tear at your flesh.
Can't you control the ecstasy?
Drowning in blood. Writhing in pain.
Transgress to... the realm of my madness!When horizons seem dim and the starlight too cold 
 Echoes don't chime anymore 'cause there's no one left to hear them 
 Fon't let you heart capsize in dismay, don't let your hope fade away 
 Take at look at yourself and realize there's more coming 
 From the future! 

 Day follows day, night follows night 
 Pick up your pride from wherever it may lay 
 Night follows night, day follows day! 
 Your step may falter, but the heart's right 
 Day follows day, night follows night! 

 If those whom you've loved once are now gone or dead 
 And their memory haunts you deep in the night 
 Embrace them one last time in your dream and smile, 
 Then turn your back to the past and walk away 
 Towards the future! 
 Day follows day, night follows night 
 Pick up your pride from wherever it may lay 
 Night follows night, day follows day! 
 Your step may falter, but the heart's right 
 Day follows day, night follows night! 
 Sadly, there is no end to this unfolding story, 
 The journey will last forever after we've been long gone 
 But behind are our sons who've looked towards the future 
 They know steps may falter but the heart's always right 
 Hail to the future! 

 Day follows day, night follows night 
 Pick up your pride from wherever it may lay 
 Night follows night, day follows day! 
 Your step may falter, but the heart's right 
 Day follows day, night follows night!Can you feel me in your chest 
Where you bear the unseen mark 
I taste your presence in my breathe 
I can see you in the dark 

Do you feel the burn again 
You're gonna learn again 
The freedom of lycanthropy 
When you start to turn again 

Do you feel that familiar feeling 
Of moonlight on your skin 
To know the death that I've been dealing 
Forget the thing you once had been 

Your howls penetrate the night 
Striking fear in human prey 
The taste of blood just feels so right 
As you bathe in arterial spray 

Unholy light glows within your eyes 
Fur is sprouting from your crooked spine 
So take a bite of a jugular vein 
Your way of life until the next day 

Harvest moon is whispering 
Your fangs glistening 
The pleasure's undeniable 
The pack shall be reborn againWe are all - marching for war 
 We are all - bleeding inside 
 We are all - feeling the pain 
 We are all - Tzook Eitan 

 Tzook Eitan - we stand and fight 
 Tzook Eitan - brave soldiers 
 Tzook eitan - we are strong 
 Tzook eitan - we always stand and fight 

 The enemy , afraid for his loss 
 We're here to keep the land 
 Soldiers of honor 
 Soldiers of war 
 We are all united! 

 We stand as a rock blocking the fire 
 We're sent to protect our people 
 sent to bring victory 
 We're fighters and always will be! 

 Tzook Eitan we stand and fight 
 Tzook Eitan brave soldiers 
 Tzook Eitan we are strong 
 Tzook Eitan we always stand and fight 

 Know behind the border death is waiting 
 Every step can be the last 

 But we shall never retreat!(Instrumental)I'm sick of you and your embrace
I want you dead from your disgrace
Boredom waits and Boredom gets
And boredom breeds what you reject
No more - I can't taste this sore
No more - We can't.... .. more
I can't move 'cause I can't hold up
And I get sick 'cause you won't shut up
The thought of you makes me wanna throw up
Because of you I won't grow up
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Bless your wounds and bless your state
slashing through our future dates - NO!
Bless your greed and kill the poor
Feed your head til it ignores
Bleed your faith and bleed your cures
Bleed yourself into your graves
Only to be a fucking slave suck yourself
until you're laid
No More - I can't take no more
We Were - I can't take this whore
I can't move cause I can't put up
I get sick when I can't grow up
The thought of you makes me wanna throw up
Because I'm dead and I won't live up
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
No more lies for me and you
No more lies in our own place
We can die in airplanes
We can die now let's fight
I get sick when I can't hold up
I can't move cause you won't shut up
The thought of you makes me wanna throw up
Because of you I will never grow up
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on you
Now I wanna throw up on youThe stickman breaks the ice
Brings all cold feelings forward
A shifting sacrifice
A little more to carry homeward
The little crimes slip by
Liquid loyalties re-incise
And reaching for the feed
They unearth a hidden greed

Who decides right and wrong?
Who decides what should be said?
I think I'll never see the path... again
Who decides right and wrong?
Who decides what should be said?
I think I'll never see the path...

A fearless choice of words
Sitting safe a world away
Traffic is a blur
And every coward has his say
Chameleons test the air
Oceans swell and overflow
But the stickman's everywhere
Eras come and eras go

Who decides right and wrong?
Who decides what should be said?
I think I'll never see the path... again
Who decides right and wrong?
Who decides what should be said?
I think I'll never see the path... again

Those who remain true
Will cut a path of their own
Constant in the slew
Weather judgments and missiles thrown
Constant in the slew
Weather judgments and missiles thrown
Constant in the slew
To forge ahead and set the tone

Who decides right and wrong?
Who decides what should be said?
I think I'll never see the path... again
Who decides right and wrong?
Who decides what should be said?
I think I'll never see the path... again
Again
AgainA flickering nocturnal beacon
Attracts my irrational mind
It tempts my mind to enter
Forbidden secrets to find

Its seduction overrides reason
It burns and gives birth
Yet mysteries it reveals to none
With roots embedded within earth

When the darkness gets colder
Closing in from the other side
Into putrid haze my senses blur
To meet my destiny without fear I ride

A fateless will I feel
A breathless form I see
I have conjured these wings of steel
That carry my spirit close to thee

As bewitching demonic chants
Are calling for unyielding purity
With memories of ancestral clans
I sink in His transcendental unity

In death this hand rose once more
In resemblance of its life of fire
Refusing that which was given
Taking what was desiredAn ancient order has awakened
Come forth friends of darkness
And heed the call of warAnd so it seems
I am unbound in my misery
Drunk in my sobriety
...and twisted animosiety
The private moments of man
Are rarely ever seen
Yet, autumn gathers me up
And sheds me in her leaves

Falling takes forever
From the grace of man
I fell so far
No one ever saw
How far

She is dressed in golden brown for me
Sheds her leaves like a second skin

There is fire, in your eyes tonight
No brighter sun, no darker moon

Sister Morrigu
This way comes,
And so it seems it is

Another passionate night
Another hopeless fight
And another battle that I've lostDo you feel that the world is your throne?
Stay and you will see, you can't run
Hiding in shadows, but still you'll have to pray
I don't believe in Heaven nor this Hell

Needles in my brain
I don't want to end insane
Tied up to a chair... just waiting

You got to run, escape from me
You know I will hurt you
Don't stay close, watch your back!
Stay with me and you'll be dead

You got to run, escape from me
You know I will hurt you
Don't stay close, watch your back!
Stay with me and you'll be dead

You got to run, escape from...
Got to run, escape from... me
You got to run, escape from...
Got to run, escape from... me

You got to run, escape from...
Got to run, escape from... me!
You got to run, escape from...
Got to run, escape from... me!!In de dorre verlaten woestijn
de plaats der vergetelheid
Waar het zwervende nomadenvolk
leeft van hun eigen vlees
De hitte die alles verschroeit
en laat rotten in de blakende zon
De veroordeelde misdadigers
die hier zoeken naar de dood

De plaag die hier heerst
In 't paradijs van stof, as en beenderen

Aasetende vogels die bidden
over de Schedelvlakte
De afgevreten hoofden
door onuitroeibaar ongedierte
Die vergaan onder het zand
en begraven worden in 't Nihil
De strop die nog hangt
aan de dode boom, voor de volgende

Verlos jezelf
Uit 't paradijs van schaduwen en gedrochten

De laatst getekende kaart
voor een uitweg, verbrand
Eens hierin verzeild geraakt
getekend zoals de rest des vee
Dwalen in het onveranderlijk landschap
Geen hoop, geen optimistisch gezeik
Het naeve verloren en beseffen
dat dit het lot zal wezen 

Gezonken en verdronken
In dit oord van waanzinThe cold breeze 
freezes the perception 
oh my freedom 
my despair 

Forced to 
work on this 
cursed 
land 

My ideology is 
lost in the 
conviction 
of life 

The cold breeze 
freezes the perception 
oh my freedom 
my despair 

Forced to 
work on this 
cursed 
land 

My ideology is 
lost in the 
conviction 
of life 

If i'd only knew 
where i was 
I thought it was a 
fairytale 

If i'd only knew 
where i was 
I thought it was a 
fairytale 

GulagDoctor, I've read your last diagnosis
About my pathology, this chimera which obsesses you
Are you serious when you call me psychotic
Just because my reality is not yours
I would be insane for that, look at your world
You live behind a wall of lies
Your children born in laboratory
Developed in bottles, fed with plastic
You dare to call it progress

chorus :

Are you so far from insanity?

The physical inferiority increased by the slow destruction
Of your body with old age, illness and death
These are ill's I've never dread

You work so hard to cause your own ruin
Colonize environment as a never sated parasite

Finding your pleasure in pain of the others
Domination you can enforce
Because I refuse this state
This human nature which chains up to eternal mediocrity
You think I'm deranged, affected by disease
Psychotic as if I was blind to the world
Blind to the world

I just wait my rebirth in a superior entity
To all these creeping larva, reminiscent of naught

chorusHigh over the rainbow, over seven seas
Far away, see the sign, see the light in the sky

In the valley of kingdom
After the battle we won
Hear the silence of courageous souls
Resting forever

All the warriors are marching
'n riding on and on
For freedom they're longing for
Until the day their time will come

High and higher let's ride

Let's ride up high, high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away, far away
See the sign, see the sign
The light in the sky

Let's fly up high, high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away, far away
See the light, see the light
The shine in the night

In the line of fire
They keep their steel up high
Under the rays of the blazing sun
Controlled by an electric eye

At the end of the ocean
Over the top of the hills
Where the rivers of destiny
Flow in the lake of eternity

High and higher let's fly

Let's ride up high, high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away, far away
See the sign, see the sign
The light in the sky

Let's fly up high, high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away, far away
See the light, see the light
The shine in the night

Let's ride on the rainbow, over seven seas
For freedom they're longing for until the day their time will come

At the end of the ocean, over the top of the hills
Where the rivers of destiny flow in the lake of eternityMusic: Moliti
Lyrics: Moliti

Here I stand watching
The crash of the water parching
For the unknown
Beyond this violent shore

The deep of the gaping void
Will surely swallow you whole
Return is no option, only death
By the shadows of the dark

And every night
I dream of foreign lands
Unconscious memories
On golden shores
Its haunting me, calling me

Chorus:

Take me
Beyond the horizon
My destiny
Into the sea

Take me
The distant tides
Of my memory
Beckon to me

Now I stand wondering
Shall I risk my life for a dream
Still its so pure
I must find what lies beyond

The force of the ocean winds
Is sure to tear you down
Return give up all hope, you'll be under
By the light of the dawn

And every night
I dream of paradise
An ancient legacy
The crystal spheres
I've got to get back to it

Chorus:

Take me
Beyond the horizon
My destiny
Into the sea

Take me
The distant tides
Of my memory
Beckon to me

In the deepest of my dreams
I see it now
A phantom image etched into my mind
Now there's no turning back
I've made my choice
To sail to that legendary place
Or to my death

(solo)

Chorus x2For years for this felling of intimacy
This pleasant well-known shower
Of endearment
My love for you burns like a fire
In my deepest self

Your life is the absolute
Perfection on earth
People would kill for these
Feelings and emotions
My thoughts circle around your life,
Around our life till eternity

You are the enrichment of my life
You are the vitality of my life
My heart enflames at the sight of you

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

But i would never like to miss
The feeling
Once i gave you my heart
And you treat it like your own
Flesh and blood
Emotions say more then
Thousand words

With you to the end of the world
To the end of our life
Neither death nor satan are
Capable of seperating us

You are the enrichment of my life
You are the vitality of my life
My heart enflames at the sight of you

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

For love
For love

You are the enrichment of my life
You are the vitality of my life
My heart enflames at the sight of you

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

I would die if i couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
couldn't feel your love
I hear you smile
Your voice in my dreams
When i wake day and night

Your eyes are like a drug
For love
For loveArena of Invasion

 Chorus

Political organized crime
Always shifting the blame
Bombs, bullets and friendly fire
A dangerous game

Drilling for oil
Under lethal pretence
Weaponry documents
Dramatic, yet falsified

Sibilant lies 
Cause blackened skies
Bloodied arena of 
Invasion

Verse 1
The circle of corruption spoils
The minds of those who stand in power
Conspiracy blinds us from the truth, the
Path we take has just turned sour
Incidents are conjured up to 
Mask the underlying plan
Disaster cannot change its course, 
The cries just echo in the sand

Verse 2
The shots fire back, no welcome mat
They know they're not here Just for peace
The flag of truce is the hangman's noose, 
The invaders fire and do not cease
Air ripped by marauding blades
Sand whipped by metallic treads
Legions of thieves in rank and file
Can only create more hate and dread

Bridge
Insurgence needles from all sides
Death forever breathing down your neck
Cowering in shadows, boiling frustration
Ever-present killing spawns seething rage

Oil, greed
Just breed
War, pain
Lies, and gain

For those with everything wanting more

 
(Lyrics by Matt Dawson, Mike Angus)Storm of the century
Bitter blasting cold
Ferocious winds
It's raining death we're told

From the black skies
Cold snow falls fast
Trapping life where it stands
Mother nature strikes again

Frozen wastelands throughout
Endless winter storms threaten civilization
This is the end
No life survives in this land

Eternal storms, No more light
Earth's surface covered in ice
Tundra graveyards and cold black hearts
Bitter winter storms tear this world apart

Absolute zero
Tears turn to ice before falling from your face
Hypothermic blast
Cold air strikes and you're frozen to death in placeChildren of Sunyata - children of the void
Rise up and greet the storm!
Whispers echoes through eternity
Ancient wovs from an age forlorn

Black clouds are gathering, tension fills the air
A cold mist sweeps in over the land
The predicted return of our king to be
the promised rapture is now close at hand

The glorious advent of the zeroth dimension
the endtime so divine
Over the winds of the approaching storm
The bells of apocalypse chime

Freezing winds of divination
sweep across a desolate earth
the rise of the king of kings
the ancient serpent's rebirth

The triumphant advent of the zeroth dimension
The blazing dawn of a timeless time
Over the winds of the pernicious storm
Hear the bells of deliverance chime

Reverberating through countless millenniaDefied by succession of life,
forgotten their moments behind.
You're here now and they are the past,
the old voices stuck with the walls.

Frequencies past
Silent sounds don't lie.
What once was alive, is now inside.

Frequencies last,
voices inside.
What once was, is now alive.

Mad clocks, damn lie in my mind.
Stop talking about wasting your time.
Stop the clock, listen the moments past.
And measure life by every moment alive.

See the mechanism in which you live.
See within the walls what we are. Just see.

You're here and they are the past.
The old voices stuck between the walls.the time has come to destroy the gay fake asses that think they are metal
Slipknot are clowns that needs to suffer slaughter them all
Clawfinger fucking swines that needs to be butchered 
Motherfucking dick Korn are fucking apes that need to be killed off
Cradle of whore are pathetic scums that  must be nailed down 
limp Bizkit uhh motherfucking Limp Gaykit fucking gay parade beat them to death 
At last all hatred goes to the pedophiles from Linkin Park torture them to death put a rusty knife in their assholes cut of their tongues feed them to the vultures  and  let  the vultures shit them out over the desert 
Destruction of Posers 
Only true metal will remainWalking the street of this town, dragging my way through slow
Dirty snow covered in white, the reptile slept in a burrow
Glance for the strangers for leave, grief in the hearts of me
Crowding bus stuck on the crossing, grannies cursing the moon

Some of the sins revealed, so nothing new under the sky
Thoughts have been lost, our minds have been cleared
Men will never be undaunted, brothers will always feel fear
These are the moments of falling, ring of eternal hour

We are damned in the night, loosing the hold
We are stain in the wall, flowing down to the ground

Promises torn at the pieces, blood stained to ground with tears
Breeze of storm and blaze are blowing again and again
For men it ashes like demmise, stinking like incurious stance
Those who wanted to save, theu won't see the sun

Close back your eyes, there's nothing changing for a while
We'll get stuck to the chair ruined wind in the air
Waters are frozen to melt farther away as we sleep throught the mysteriesthis requim is more of a life then a death
a death in part sleeping deeply
dreams coinside
hesitation gone
control is gone
fear still present
but that's ok
you can't live your life away
into the trance
slip away
journey along
steady pace for there's no rush
we're entering now
your thoughts are done
they are mine now
i vanquish your motive and your will to do anything in particularWandering through pale dimensions
Confused in a bizarre nightmare
With no shape and no direction
This dark tunnel leads you somewhere

As eyeless creature

After long years in the pure void
Blinded by light yes - I'm near
In the past and now I bring you fear
Wake up white dwarf is hear

Something strange is in your mind
Endless delight you want more
Now you know that you are found
This pure power comes from core

Consciousness is coming in time
There are many around all over
Just a small motion and they come
Connect with you and become

A sirius midnight is rising again
Fearless beauty with black heart
Your journey was not not in vein
A rebirth ov my darkest part

In my heart deadly madness strong affration
In the darkness reincarnationI welcome you to the funeral, 
grand masquerade ball of death
Mask of treachery, smiles of dread, 
we're here to dig a thousand feet grave 
An innocent soul, deep inside, 
cries can be heard, 
Clawing at the narrow wall, 
grasping at the hollow air 
looking for a way out to freedom 
It's time to meet the same, fate 
What's the answer to the question, death 
Making the way for your, grave
The time has come for you to be, demolished 
The hole you dug to bury innocence
has swung open again 
Beckoning you to the same submission
that once you made so clear for the universe 
The walls closing in, blocking you out 
From the vanity you sucked away 
Corruption, domination all shut off,
the soul along the way escaping from you 
It's time to meet the same, fate 
What's the answer to the question, death 
Making the way for your, grave
The time has come for you to be, demolished
The treachery, apostasy 
Take place beside you 
Claustrophobia grabs you by the throat 
The torture, the torment 
That once you, inflicted, 
with the pain, pins you down 
Slams you down on your fucking mouth 
Bring forth the leviathan 
We're digging your grave 
Vultures circling overhead 
Looking for your flesh 
The walls so narrow 
Suffocating your breath 
How does it feel 
To meet the same fate 
I welcome you to the funeral, 
grand masquerade ball of death 
Mask of treachery, smiles of dread, 
we're here to dig a thousand feet grave 
An innocent soul, deep inside, 
cries can be heard, 
Clawing at the narrow wall, 
grasping at the hollow air 
looking for a way out to freedom
Everyone has gathered 
Bring out your weapons 
We're the demolishers 
Forcing you down your thousand feet, grave(Instrumental)I don't want this world to be like planet of the apes
who the hell put you in charge,
you only make mistakes
blow it up and tear it down
then let the apes start over?
why don't someone speak for me,
is my name fuckin rover?

don't wanna go in the forbidden zone
never knowing anything outside of your home
finally realize that's there's no escape
get your filthy, stinkin paws of me you damn dirty apes

most people I see are less human then an ape
cranking babies out, like factories of hate
I hate it when I have to wake up from my fantasy

where everybody works and pays taxes just like me

don't wanna go in the forbidden zone
never knowing anything outside of your home
finally realize that's there's no escape
get your filthy, stinkin paws of me you damn dirty apes

lock them in a cage like a monkey in a zoo
stare at me and laugh, but I am telling you the truth
lock them in a cage like a monkey in a zoo
We'll see who laughs last the day when monkeys rise to ruleRise up spirits of our ancestors
Join in bakhik dance again
Dance the dance of Dioskouros
And raise your swords on air

A Temple is rising
Breaks through the ground
An eagle is flying
A sign of Zeus
The Titan has awaken up
And seeks revenge
An order of the Olymbians
HELLENIC GODS

As the Titan awakes
As the Aeolian winds proclaim
The conquers END..

Nymphs were laughing in woods of Athos
But now raped by Christian cross

The earth has opened the Titan has risen
Athona! Once you threw the huge rock
Now throw it again on the conquers heads

As the eagle lands on the top of a temple of Zeus
The true light of Apollo burns the Christian cross
The rock is now been threw as the Olymbian ordered
And smashes the Christian cross and their fake Jewish godUpon your arrival
You halt and look away
You cannot believe your eyes
This is all that remains

There is nothing left

You have fallen victim to anguish
You have seen nothing but dispair
You have lost your will to live
You have gained nothing but pain

Damned by light
You see the wrath of angels
You curse the sky
Denouncing your faith in torment
Falling to your knees in anger
Your fist hits the ground
Blaming everything that stood in your path
Nothing else matters now

In your hand is the drying bloodshed
In your soul there is nothing left
In your eyes is the burning hatred
In your heart is the cold revenge

This is your last threat
Show them revenge
Put them to death
You will have their headsRunning through the corridors of this forsaken ship
My hate grows with every beat of heart
I feel like a movement and feel flash before me
Hear your screams my victim, now you last time

You are emptiness, you my food
You warm meat is so beutiful
Bloody massacre come so close
Bloody massacre come with holocaust

Before my supper I'm sweet sleep on the floor
But without of warning i feel the pain
What I see before my eyes - lovely life forms
What I feel - they try to kill?

You are emptiness, you my food
You warm meat is so beautyful
Bloody massacre come so close
Bloody massacre come with holocaustfight for life
fight to survive
fight until death
or be tortured alive(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Fullmoon Passions

I Look Deep Into The Night
As ThePassion Fills My Eyes

...Forevermore...

Fullmoon Passions

I Crave The Hunt Tonight
Through My Howling Cries

I Shall Wait For Sun-Down
With Fullmoon PassionsFuckin' Inquisitors of Braunschweig
Were the most famous by their cruelty...
In the time of raving Inquisition
Triers from Braunschweig
Tormented and killed the Hennig Brabant
(who was the scholar of law)
This disgraceful murder
was the most infamous act
in the history of Inquisition
(in the history of Vile Inquisition)
...One disastrous day of September, 1604,
Hennig Brabant writhed in pain and agonized
by "Rabid Jackals"...
"Qui habet aures audiendi, audiat!"
Unprecedented torture - In the name Of God
Unprecedented torture - In the name of the Lord
Under the influence of torture
The scholar of law, Hennig Brabant
Confessed his "Hideous Sin":
The alliance with Satan
After this gory process,
On the seventeenth of September, 1604,
Terrible Occurences were started:
On the place of execution
The low scoundrels of Inquisition
Crushed the Brabant's chest
And ripped the belly of the half-dead man
Soon after the Bloodthirsty Executioner
Tore the heart of poor victim...
GOD REST HIS SOUL!He is in front the Altar 
Dealing with her god
In her trance she dont hear you
So fuck her in the butt

Fuck the priestess on the Altar of Satan

You smash her head against the wall
She screams the final call
Rip apart her clothes
only see her hole

Fuck the priestess on the Altar of Satan

Now!

In this dark Ritual 
her is given satans Child
No way out of here
She is screaming wild

Fuck the Priestess on the Altar of SatanReconcidering my faith and existence,
I have suffered too long from this distance.
Thinking I've got nothing left to loose,
An end is not an answer but a poor excuse.

I never felt a comfort or a warm embrace,
I look into the mirror to see my shattered face.
Hate has made me loose control,
I can't see the wounds that burned my soul.

When night falls fast,
I can't get no sleep.
Crying about my past,
I'm in way too deep.

My dreams were buried a long time ago,
Nothing to live for, there's nothing to grow.
The social stigma keeping me behind,
Feelings of euphoria and hatred entwined.

There's nothing left for me to grief,
I want to end this pain and find relief.
This will be the last word I'll write,
I want to release my body and soul tonight.

When night falls fast,
I can't get no sleep.
Crying about my past,
I'm in way too deep.

Poisoned blood clouding my weak mind,
I reflect on everything I'll leave behind.
All the sorrow and pain I've ever felt,
Every single lover I've never kissed or held(Instrumental)Each time the thought of suicide
Death comes in my mind
suicide is my solution
I cut my body and start to bleed
there is no remedy, no cure, there is no hope

I climb on the chair
the string is already in my neck

is my last moment
just end it all now

die with me, our last moment
I did not explain my reasons
I ate through my depression
my mind was destroyed
there is nothing else than suicideCities of immortal sin
Lacerating of bodies
Fuck the rites
Altar sacrifice
Road to pleasure
Infernal heresy
Pagans and blasphemers
Idolazind fifth idols
The pleasure and hate only reign
The high priest is polokai
Offering sacrifices
To Lilith
Asmodeus
And Azagoth

Sodom and Gomor
Cities of lust
Asmodeus control them
Lilith possessed them
Pleasure and lewdness
Pagans and blasphemers
Seducing the feeling
The cult in the temple
Oe Klattu Narada Fixto(Instrumental)The years when the child was filled of strengthen sensations passed by,
When he would sit on the riverside, motherly cared by the trees which did wrap him in their foliage

A lot of things happened so that he understood who he was and which man was asleep inside of him since ever

Many years passed by during which silence took place as an unseparable wall, all around him

No scream could get out from this hurricane which had been blowing inside of him for such a long time...

Cause him is me
Cause him is me
Cause him is me
Cause him is mespectral Vision

Through the city of the twilight
In the farthest of the sea
Behold the beauty
So limbonic, so morbid, so bright
Temptations within my heart arise 

Princess of the doom
The territory of the infamous land conqured
The lover of unholy dark
Never pure, never possesed
Blood masterbation, purity overthrown

She's all to me, the mysterious
The look in the eyes blood designed
Desires of these voilent overtue
It's all never to show
Her name upon my words
Last words now never to hide 
Everynight never tonight
The promise of another truth always denied
Everyday live inside the lie
Whatever you say
Your purity's overthrown

Narcissus hate as their pride
Binded by the circle of the death mirror
Through the pride which will never die for all the time

If wishes could only fray that bond
Pray forever as i pass on u whore rebel
I never want to find on from dusk till dawn

Enter the nightmare of Utopia
This is the secret garden
Where desert storm claim eden
Lost in the death field horizon

All there is now that is fear to me
Is only u that is causing the fear to me
What is there inside, i can never define
Now all i can see is thy spectral visions
All i can see thy spectral visions
All i fear is thy spectral visions
All that ever haunts me is thy spectral visions(Instrumental)The innocence of murder

To take a life to survive, it tasted better dead than alive. But we kill for luxury, the leisure of supremacy.

The government must amplify, and weapons made to simplify. The violence against animals, otherwise their powers will fail.

Murdering is what we do: (To take control of everything, to fulfill and satisfy). We cannot see that is why, our world is slowly falling apart. We might as well kill ourselves, and relieve the innocent bystandard. Which are the animals. Which is inevitable.

Life

As the earth warms and nourishment becomes scarce, we are forced to walk new paths for our hunger. We then look to eachother, we are all that remains...and to keep our species alive...we eat ourselves.

Taking your life

I look up to the red sky, our dead world below. We have taken everything away and now we take ourselves.We burned the bridges down and let
All perish from the ashes of old
We'll resurface to rise again
Nothing will break down the faith
That we have all this turmoil will
Only regain our strength
Nothing will ever appear in our way
We were destined to prove all the
Thing that we say

Come with me into the trance
Join us in the final dance
Cause it will not last, so
Let us raise our glass
Now together here we stand

Once again we burned the bridges down
We have risen and proven ourselves
One more time
Nothing will strangle the passion
Within the flame that we lit, will
Still burn as it did
For we are but slaves to what destiny
Named a sickness in every thinkable way(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)This place which nobody knows, 
Where lights carry you away, 
away from where the river flows, 
and night is your new day. 
Where the stars come alive. 
Going nowhere, 
I feel the noose around my throat, 
I climb these stairs up to the heavens... 
This is hell.(Instrumental)Taking off the sand
I find strange ancient artifacts
Hands that shaped the frescos
Obsolete machine of Antikythera

Posthumous builders
Invisibly manufactured
Shaped in a mysterious matter
Sacred death relic(s)

Destruction of wisdom
Devastation of the unspeakable
On this mysterious land
Worshipping the dust

Find the code to decipher
The unreal and strange instrument
Amulet of the hateful
Disturbing creation

Through strange artifacts
I can see the past emerge
Like a dark dream
In shades of copper
Of strange artifacts

In this endless desert
These arid plains
Where death enchants usAlways turn your head, 
let the others bite the shit 
talk behind the back! 
Never stand tall! 

Follow without brain every good rethoric man 
which like a rat - catcher waits! 
To manipulate your fate! 

Little Gurus profitate from 
the fear and from the hate 
so we see what money does! 
With the brainlessness of us! 

Their accounts will be so fat 
because money is not bad 
so they gamble what they can! 
With the naivety of men! 

On the back of little fools 
they build houses, swimmingpools 
travel with their privite - plane! 
To destroy another men! 

They abuse their might and 
they promise you the light 
so much people will get sad! 
Illuminate themselves to death! 

This god who dethroned us 
has destroyed our fantasies 
This god..... 

From age to age we forget 
to live on our own!!!(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)(Instrumental)he whose hands shape the tremors, arise 
he who reigns in fire, arise 
a light ignited, a mark of sins produced 
the one has been chosen the portal is open 
a new epoch now born 
violent splitting of the earth 
cracking from the core 
defilement of artifact 
and the scent of the dead 
raise the hands, bow in ritual 
vessels aligned, scattered in unison 
raise the hands, intonations 
voices divide, spawning dysithrian 
fragments come together 
dismemberments align 
like water drawn back to ocean 
to walk again into the shadow 
a light ignited, a mark of sins produced 
the one has been chosen the portal is open 
a new epoch now born 
blood fills the streets 
blood fills the sky 
blood washes over our cities 
blood is everywhere 
the new world is born... 
the new world is bathed.. 
...in bloodThey're on their way to massacre
While marching through the night
With mind lost in prayers
In blood they thrust the light
They're fighting in the name of god
Devoted to their cause
Their courage must be proven
Slay the evil followers
Proudly under their flags
They will ride
They are following holy beliefs
On sacred land they ride
And send the souls to damnation
But there are still so many battles
And many deaths until triumph
Let divine light shine through
Devours
Hold the book of reasons
All the evil preachers burn
Holy killers
They use the book of god a reason
To send the lost souls to damnation
Holy killers
They'll free the sacred land of all
The preachers
Holy killers
They ride off winds of light
To be saved
Still they wander through
The darkness of their life
Should have let it go
When the light came haunting you
Should have let it go
Let it live without no fearMoje ime je zlobno
Mrzim vas prokleti hriscani
Morate od moje ruke pasti
Svi ste vi umno poremeceni

Satanizam je sloboda
Hriscanstvo je bolest
Lucifer je bog
Isus je ortodoksni lazov

Vjerujte u gubavca
Lazova i nehumaniste
Iscjelitelja lazi i prevare

Gradite vase crkve pogane
Bacajte milijarde pokradene

Bestial agelast on surgeons face(Instrumental)Baptized in Serpent's blood, I wait for thee.
Bloodstained rituals carves names into me.
Visions mesmerized whispers obscure
of long forgotten Sins, Salvation insecure.

I have read of Stones that wept wounded.
I have seen old Trees that once cried.
I live the Curse of the meaning forever
and all I have left is to sing you to me.

I sing you to me!(Instrumental)I can't believe the sun is shining
After all I've been through
The breeze invites my interest
And how can I refuse ?
The anecdote of the jar
It's taken so long,to get this far
The actor takes his final bow
But...just look at me now
My mind is strong & silent
My thoughts are clear & bright
Crisp & bold
It's my will that holds the key
I once was weak of interest
I once feared dark of night
I once was blind
But now my eyes can see
I can't see through 
The window of time
Or answer to the puzzled rhyme
I can't mend my broken vow
But...just look at me now
They pulled me from the wreckage
Battered & left for dead
Nerves of steel
Could not conceal my pain
My life has become a schedule
My life became a bed
The needle burn
Was how I learned the game
I can't see through
The window of time
Or answer to the puzzled rhyme
I can't mend my broken vow
But...just look at me nowUnholy master Satan, take my blackened soul
Show me the secret gate
Where the lord of darkness rule
Take away my life
Take it far away
Take it to the shadows
I must die

Into realms of darkness
Where eternal shadows fall
My soul shall be free
Departed from the dying world
Embreced by the dark lord
My soul shall be immortal
Forever and ever I follow
My master Satans call

In the sign of the horns
Come and take my life
In the sign of the horns
I must die

Satan - hear my cries of anger
Come forth from the shadows - and take my life away
Master - sacrifice my soul
Make me one with darkness - Satan let me free

In the sign of the horns
Come and take my life
In the sign of the horns
I must die

Into realms of darkness
Where eternal shadows fall
My soul shall be free
Departed from the dying world
Embreced by the dark lord
My soul shall be immortal
Forever and ever I follow
My master Satans call

Satan - hear my cries of anger
Come forth from the shadows - and take my life away
Master - sacrifice my soul
Make me one with darkness - Satan let me free

In the sign of the horns
Come and take my life
In the sign of the horns
I must dieMy words are carnal, they've got elbows lips
They groved by the skin
Blood flow through them, spittle are dripping through them
Glands are growling in them
cold air is hissing in the lugs of my words
they've got liver, kidney about spine is beating
Hairy muscle, black heart of words
My words are carnal
their skin is peeling
Kidneys are blocking
Gums are rotting to them
Heart is pumping sand in the dry weins of words
Hair is getting off
The tongue is breaking down
Glands producing white sweet mould
Cancer is storing black eggs in the spine of flesh
Nerves are rotting separetly
pituary gland separetly
Liver of words is refusing
Obedience to words
Heart is cracking to them
And from the open laryx
Flowing foamy stream
Spittle
Blood
and phlegmI drank of your poison, and I praised your name
You led me to ruin, and tricked me to take part in your shame
Though seasons change, in your hell you shall remain
I will praise the day when you lie dead in your grave

I'll eat the hand that feeds you
A sadistical beast, you seek the tight grip of the noose
Watch you starve, naked, beaten and forlorn
I'll be the henchman that sets you loose

Drugged from the first touch by your hand
A trophy, still breathing, lies waiting for your death
Once field in mental chains, this dog's buy now unleashed
Firm jaws now snap across your neck

Possessed eyes encircling every move
Let the sounds of the night suffocate your lament
The shadows darkening your face
Endless scorn buried in my veins

As a constrictor I'll sense your warm pulse
Sepulchre, tins is your time to die as those you have hurt
The choir of your twisted gospels forever rings in my ears
Onward cowards salvation, I know I can't win

Grinding the wheels of my existence
To always feel persecuted on a trail of treason and fear
Cause I know you will escape from the womb that sucked you in
Carefully watching me as I burn in the ruins where I stored the anger withinAs bastard sons of hate
of men
we came to bring
our lies among the pure
we rise to announce
the fall of your lord
we are here to win

We have no mother
we are born
from hate
We have no mother
we are born

So with our lies
well prevail
among men
we are here
to bring disease

We have no mother
we are born
from hate
We have no mother
we are born

We are here
to see falling
all your thruths
we rise to announce
the fall of your lord
under sun
dying sun
we are here to win

All is falling
and the pure
returns to
the side of liea proverbial laxative for the vulva your pennyroyal tea need not apply 
i don't think you want this but if you insistDon't take me down 
Face to face with destiny
I see how much I have to learn
Life is a game and it plays
Tricks with our heart
To these we are submit
Is just a sentimental test
It's only supported by those who
Keep balance between the right and wrong

To be what I don't want to be
Because they still forcing me
But from the ten commands created by the humanity
Not even one is able 
To correct this creatures acts
Each thousands of
Those spoken words
They still don't know
How I feel
This is used to show me
What I shouldn't be
Can you feel my heart?
This is not TV this is real 
Don't break my soul
Don't kill my hopes
I cannot stand it anymore
Don't judge my dreams 
Don't still my faith
Don't awake my fears
Don't take me down

Clear as water truth
Fits as gloves on my hands
Giving me the power 
Just to understand
Showing which way should I keep distance from
See that reality is in our dreams and not inside our eyes 
It is worthless to be the greatest
It is worthless to be the best
It's worse to be the richest
It's worse to be the strongest
If that is real to us
This is not a dream
For who believes(Instrumental)(Instrumental)Like the sand can seep right through your fingers so can all your day
As those days go by you'll have me there to help you find the way
The way i feel with you i know it's got to last forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And i will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall i'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all and everything will be alright

Time goes by so fast
You've got to have a dream
To just hold on
All my dreams of love began
With the reality of you
You and i believe
That all our dreams will last forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And i will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall i'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all and everything will be alright

Though the sun may hide
We still can see
The light that shines for you and me

We'll be together all that we can be

And when the rain begins to fall
You'll ride my rainbow in the sky
And i will catch you if you fall
You'll never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall i'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we can have it all and everything will be alright
And when the rain begins to fallNo trumpets called
as I razed these walls
all thoughts ceased
my mind turned to ash

Where were those
who tried to save me
in these ruined streets of shame

No truths, no gods
a sun that did not rise that day
a son that did not rise that day

The lash, the tree and the nail
all it took to undo
what was "undoable"

A wasted look to the skyDepression pulls me down once more
I know that this time it's for real
Won't beg for help
No final words
A shadow I have become

I curse my life
I've tried to break free from the pain
I hate my fate
Don't let me live

My song of suffering
I give to you
My song of suffering
Anthem of doom
Give me a reason
To carry on
Give me a reason
Or hand me a gun

I enter the void
Through the gates of suicide
The plague in my flesh
Cancer of doom that you've called lifeMy Power

Illuminates the land
Swirling mists cold as ice
Enrapturing my mind

And through the fog funeral mist
Behold bloodred eyes

Mesmerized, hypnotized
By evil gleaming eyes

Dreamland nightmare
A vision in the dark,
Love dies and flames rise
As glowing embers burn

And through the flames of hell's domain
Behold bloodred eyes

Mesmerized, hypnotized
By evil gleaming eyesEmbrace my soul
Embrace my soul
Embrace my soul
Gutural songs created your winds
Creating ghost visions
The terrible prophecies of your songs
Close myself to you

Embrace my soul malignant wind
Leave fall your darkness on myself
Embrace my soul majestic winter...
Embrace my soul majestic winter...

Your cold presence full me of depression
Depression
Embrace my soul majestic winter
Now I'm inside of your colder thought
Among forest full of obscurity
Surrounded of huge mountains
I found the sadness and total depression...
My soul feel which here an true battle in their all times
True battle in their all times
Times got over to drag the majestic winter
Majestic winter
And comes with me to full my soul of true time of destruction
Embrace my soul and turn me in one part of you
Majestic winter you are sadness and depression(Instrumental)Calm and silent is the beautiful night
Soft winds appeared to increase in strength
The metallic scent of blood suddenly filled the air
Lightning of destruction fills the crumbling sky

Proud i march over the useless bleeding waste
Free from those pathetic chains that holds us to our fate
The chanting of the storms seems to be louder every night
The sky is slowly fading, and gone is the futile light

To the sound of storms, infinity will fade
To the sound of storms, damnation will reign

Mortal souls are shattered by unholy storms of chaos
Our wrath is restless violence
The sound of damnation is calling

Proud i march over the useless bleeding waste
Free from those pathetic chains that holds us to our fate
Greater storms are to come, so i have been told
Black and desolate, everything is cold. universe in universe,
No light is to be found
Black were our hearts, and black is the end

To the sound of storms, infinity will fade
To the sound of storms, damnation will reign

Mortal souls are shattered by unholy storms of chaos
Our wrath is restless violence
The sound of damnation is calling(Instrumental)Ambiguous Delirium (Emerna cover)

nought ...

	vivacious in shining gardens.
	when god absolves your ignorance.

	sleeping with shadows of cedars.
	you love your life and this joyance.

	you pray for your chilish desires,
	to something you never felt.

	to something you never saw.
	to someone you never have.

	it's for when you are sunken inside lies, where you don't belong.

	descending in baseless emptiness.
	revolving inside of nought.

	and anguished by disjointed perceptions,
	in illusive incoherent thought.

	invisible discordance of time.
	indeterminate sense into pace.

	and tearful by disjointed perceptions,
	in unreal silence of grief.

	it's for when you are drifting inside of reality, where you really are.


	believe me there's nothing than nothing.
	it's immense cycle and cypher.

	you think not I know what I say.
	you think not I know what I say.

	just feel that discordance of nature.
	believe in erosion of creature.

	deny those illusive perceptions.
	and accept your natural depression.

	believe in resumption of death.
	believe in departure of breath.

	I saw a disorder in motions.
	I saw those repugnant emotion.

	and forget sensations you sought.
	then fall into silence of nought.

	you think not you knew what I said.
	you think not you know what I'll say.

	for I saw that infinite twister blackness,
	drowned its creatures in its absolute gloom,
	and thence whatever we know,
	is positive obscurity of an absent reality, no more.

you are sunken in that gloom and this is not life,
	because gradually you outwear, to complete a cycle.
	be sure you'll never hide from erosion and revival, that's epidemic.
	now if you think you have a soul,
	I should to say that's nothing except your nerves,
	that will stop with natural erosion of your luscious flesh.
	a glorious materialistic death.
	now you can curse your parents,
	or hate this stupid humanity and their daydream.
	you can cut your flesh with a razor,
	or you can call the police or emergencies.
	or you can ... what am I talking about? ...
	I think not ... let ... I look again ...
	Ok I was a child and my dad hurt ...
	what? ... am I insane? ... where I am? ...
	what am I talking about? ...
	what am I talking about? ...
	what's this darkness? ...
	please somebody tell me what's wrong with me? ...
	no I'll be fine I'm sure ... I'll be fine ...
	and I'll be there again, yeah ...
	no I don't know, I'm not sure, I'm not sure ...
	psychosis? ...
	what? ...
	cycle? ...
	emptiness? ...
	emptyness? ...

	huahaa ...

(Lyrics untouched, and written by Emerna and were given to Learza)(Instrumental)On The Wings Of Nightmare

I had a dream before
Across the enchanted night
Believing in your fears so much 
That I became the truly living lie
Trapped in this dream I tried to understand
Why spiders try to fly and eagles try to crawl in sand

Creatures from nothing are falling on me
I just saw their immense scars 
trying to carry my only light

You know, I have been so wicked
So you know, the only way out
But you know, this was just a dream
You know, this was just a dream

Screams in vain, desperation in dead gallery
I had to grin on their face
Because my blaze was extinguished by their rage

My cremator was there,
laughing he knew all my fears 
and grimly he was approaching to me

You know, I have been so desperate
So you know, the only way out
But you know, this was just a dream
I am so glad, this was just a dream
Nothing to fear, this was just a dream
But I realize, I have not wake up (yet).An ancient malady 
Older than the pyramids 
Suppresed for millenia 
Clotted in the heart 

An endless torment 
Beyond all imagination 
Torture of the mind 
Of the body and soul 

Anaesthesia dolorosa 
A pain without an end 
Anaesthesia dolorosa 
A prayer for death 

A paralyzing fear 
Of horror yet to come 
An agonizing awareness 
Of the useless existence 

An unbearable anguish 
Inner hunger and thirst 
The ultimate nightmare 
Of the human scumYou're losing sight
Break the hold and see the light
Break this cycle
Break your flesh
Crucify
Break you flesh
Let it die
Break your flesh
Surrender the Hyde
Break your flesh
Live to gratify
Break your flesh
Crucify
Break you flesh
Let it die
Kill your flesh
Surrender the Hyde
Break your flesh
Live to gratify
Sickens me to the core
I do not do what I want to
Instead I do what I hate the most
Disobedience
I feel like cutting loose
With this enemy that is killing me from within
Always causing me to stumble
Run away from the sin
It follows me everywhere I go
There must be blood on my knees from so many prayers
Behold, the flesh is a snare, a recurring nightmareLost symbols in decades of rightness
Prove me the strength of faith
The way of purity wrote with sores
Hamstrings tighten in constriction
A breathing statue sweating fear
A priceless act no doubtful denial...
A deeper sense to your spells
A bloodline consumed in sodomy
Render me your martyr's glance
Lost symbols in decades of rightness
Prove me the strength of faith
The way of purity wrote with sores
Creeping into this dry desert of convulsed flesh
Where a lack of passion shines
Into meticulosity measures by perfection
Each stroke blessed, each spasm kissed
Each look cut toward a higher degree of rigor
A deeper sense to your spells
A bloodline consumed into sodomy
Render me your martyr's glance
Lost symbols in decades of rightness
Prove me the strength of faith
The way of purity wrote with sores
Hamstrings tighten in constriction
A breathing statue sweating fearI've seen strange signs on my way 
 Silent shadows 
 Dancing shapes 
 And angels fallen on the earth
